mack et al. 2000; sakai et al. 2001). mechanisms of introduction include hitchhiking (e.g., in ballast water, on vehicles, or while attached to boats, birds, or other dispersants), nuisance species control (e.g., release of herbivores or predators for biocontrol) and accidental or intentional release of plants and animals used in aquaculture, pet trade, cuisine and as sport bait. regardless of the mechanism, introductions are very often permanent, and effects can be econom- ically vast (pimentel et al. 2000). the laurentian great lakes region of north america in particular has seen a large number of nonindigenous species, many of which have had deleterious effects on the invaded ecosystem (mills et al. 1993). since the discovery of eurasian ruffe gymnocepha- lus cernuus (l.) in lake superior in the mid-1980s, ecologists and ﬁshery managers have feared that this non-native percid may interact negatively with native ﬁshes (ogle 1998). particular attention has focused on the potential for ruffe to compete with yellow perch perca ﬂavescens (l.), an important sport and com- mercial ﬁsh, for benthic invertebrates when ﬁsh are age 1+ and primarily benthivorous (ogle 1998). yellow perch are ecologically similar to eurasian perch perca ﬂuviatilis (craig 1987). in europe and asia, ruffe co-occur with eurasian perch in lakes and rivers, both where ruffe are native (craig 1987) doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00114.x 1 fullerton & lamberti and introduced (adams 1991; winﬁeld et al. 1996). competition has not been documented in lakes where ﬁshes co-evolved, but there is concern that ruffe may be competing with perch in invaded ecosystems. in pond enclosures (bergman & greenberg 1994) and aquaria (fullerton et al. 2000) lacking predators, growth of both perch and ruffe declined with increas- ing density of ruffe, suggesting that competition for food is possible. in laboratory studies directly obser- ving behaviour of ﬁshes foraging for limited resources, abilities of ﬁshes to consume food depended on ﬁsh density (savino & kolar 1996) and substrate (dieter- ich et al. 2004). previous studies have focused on the likelihood that ruffe and perch compete for food resources. in this study, we investigated competition for habitat space and how habitat use may inﬂuence species interac- tions. we hypothesised that, as found in ﬁeld studies, ruffe would primarily prefer mud (ogle 1998) and yellow perch would prefer macrophytes (kjellman et al. 1996; weaver et al. 1997), and that if the two species competed for habitat space, it would be most evident at high ﬁsh densities. based on predicted habitat preferences by ﬁshes, we expected that relative feeding abilities within habitat types would differ by species (i.e., ruffe would consume more food in mud and perch would consume more food in macrophytes). moreover, we expected that increased habitat structure would reduce the total amount of food consumed by both species because predators often forage less efﬁciently in complex habitats (crowder & cooper 1982; starry et al. 1998; kolar et al. 2002). to test these predictions, we conducted two sets of laboratory experiments to determine (i) use of mud, cobble and macrophyte habitat by ruffe and yellow perch, and whether ﬁshes competed for habitat space, and (ii) feeding efﬁciency by ruffe and yellow perch in each habitat. methods ruffe (ages 1–3) were collected in the st louis river estuary of lake superior by trawling whereas yellow perch were ice-ﬁshed from small lakes in michigan or obtained from large ponds in a commercial michigan hatchery. wild-caught yellow perch (age 1+) were used in habitat experiment a, whereas hatchery-raised yellow perch (age 1+) were used in subsequent experiments. we recognise that hatchery- reared ﬁsh may not be representative of wild ﬁsh, but we were unable to catch sufﬁcient numbers of wild perch that were similar in size to available ruffe. fish were held in the laboratory at 15 °c for approxi- mately 30 days prior to use in experiments. the photoperiod used during acclimation and in experi- ments was 12l:12d. 2 habitat use experiments most of our knowledge of habitat use by ruffe and yellow perch comes from ﬁeld surveys that generally cannot reveal speciﬁc habitat use because of collection methods. we conducted a series of laboratory experi- ments to investigate habitat preferences of ruffe and yellow perch separately and together to determine if competition existed for habitat space. treatments consisted of a crossed design of three densities (absent, low and high) of each ﬁsh species. in the ﬁrst experiment (habitat experiment a), we used 0, 3 )2 of each species, and each treatment was and 6 ﬁshæm replicated six times. because of limited numbers of tanks, some replicates were performed through time over four runs (each run consisted of one entire replicate and a partial replicate of the eight treatments). in addition, some ﬁsh were reused up to four times, but were held and fed in holding tanks for 2 days between uses. between runs, we removed ﬁsh and re-randomised the position of the three habitats within a tank and the ﬁsh selected for treatments. in the second experiment (habitat experiment b), we )2, and treatments were used 0, 4 and 8 ﬁshæm replicated 12 times over eight runs. again, ﬁsh were reused up to four times, but never on consecutive days. in each experiment, ruffe and yellow perch were of similar size, but size differed between experiments because of size availability [habitat experiment a: ruffe 14.2 ± 5.5 g wet mass (mean ± sd), yellow perch 15.7 ± 6.7 g; habitat experiment b: ruffe 7.9 ± 1.9 g, yellow perch 8.1 ± 1.5 g]. fish were further matched for size within tanks. densities of ruffe in the st louis river estuary of lake superior (ogle 1998) and yellow perch in lake memphrema- gog, quebec (hanson & leggett 1986), of similar size as used in our experiments, were each around )2. thus, we reasoned that densities in our 1–2 ﬁshæm )2 combined) were high experiments (3–16 ﬁshæm enough to detect competition for space, if it existed. for both experiments, experimental arenas were 1-m2 circular tanks ﬁlled with untreated groundwater to 25-cm depth (230 l). we placed equal pie-shaped portions of three types of habitat, randomly ordered, in the bottoms of 12 tanks. habitat types were mud, cobble and macrophytes; cobble and macrophytes were placed over 2–3 cm of mud. habitat experiment a was conducted during winter when ice cover on lakes precluded collection of natural substrates, so we used plastic plant analogues (equal amounts of mimics )2) of myriophyllum and vallisneria; c.145 shootsæm and a combination of commercially available sand and potting soil for mud substrate. cobble used in all experiments was collected from a quarry. no food organisms were present in tanks. habitat experiment b was conducted the following summer with natural mud and live plants (ceratophyllum; c. 225 shoot- )2) collected from a michigan lake. macrophyte sæm densities fell within the range reported for littoral zones of lakes (chick & mcivor 1997). natural foods present in ﬁeld-collected mud and plants were supplemented liberally with commercially obtained live chironomids (chironomus spp.) or blackworms (lumbriculus spp.) food was not limiting as competition for food could alter habitat use by ﬁsh. substrates were placed in tanks 1–2 days before ﬁsh were added to allow mud to settle and ambient invertebrates to associate with preferred substrates. we added supplemental food organisms to all three habitat types in each tank 30 min before putting ﬁsh in tanks. to ensure that in habitat experiment b, the impact of ﬁshes on invertebrate fauna in habitats might have affected habitat use by ﬁshes in successive experimental runs if invertebrates were depleted. to minimise this possi- bility, we fed ﬁsh prior to using them in experiments, supplemented invertebrates in the tanks and random- ised treatments among tanks between runs. temperatures in experimental tanks (14–17 °c) were similar to those in ﬁsh-holding tanks (15 °c), because both were on a ﬂow-through system using the same water source. therefore, we reasoned that 30 min was sufﬁcient for ﬁsh to acclimate in experi- mental tanks before observations began. using visual observations, we recorded the number of ruffe and yellow perch occupying each habitat every 15 min for 4 h in the light (n ¼ 16 observations) followed by the same procedure for the same ﬁsh in the dark, for a total of 8 h consecutively. in habitat experiment a, we used a red light to observe ﬁsh in the dark. against the backdrop of artiﬁcial substrates, it was easy to identify a ﬁsh to species in either light or dark. in habitat experiment b, it was very difﬁcult to see ﬁsh against the natural substrates, even in the light. therefore, we marked ﬁsh by injecting nontoxic tempera paint subcutaneously on both sides of the dorsal ﬁn of each individual. ruffe were marked with ﬂuorescent yellow whereas yellow perch were marked with ﬂuorescent pink. fish were marked 30 days prior to the experi- ment so that we could monitor their condition. marks did not noticeably affect ﬁsh health or behaviour. during the experiment, ﬁsh were easily identiﬁed in the light and under black light in the dark. we used a hand-held tape recorder to record observations before ﬁsh could respond to our presence. we also noted qualitative behavioural differences between ﬁsh spe- cies, such as the levels of activity of each species in the light and dark. fish did not appear to notice our presence during observations, nor did they respond to red or black light. habitat experiments a and b differed in at least six ways: (i) ﬁsh densities; (ii) ﬁsh size, (iii) yellow perch resource use by ruffe and yellow perch source; (iv) unmarked versus marked ﬁsh; (v) artiﬁcial versus real mud and macrophytes (and at different shoot density); and (vi) absence or presence of food. thus, we analysed the two experiments separately. for statistical analyses, we analysed the preference by ruffe or yellow perch for a particular habitat; we deﬁned this as the mean proportion of time that all individuals per species in a given tank of a given treatment spent in a given habitat. determining statistical signiﬁcance of differences among prefer- ences is challenging because the preferences are not independent of one another (i.e., the preference for a given habitat is partially dependent on the magnitude of preferences for other habitats). to overcome this, we evaluated preference using compositional analysis, a special application of multivariate analysis of variance (manova) (aebischer et al. 1993; chick & mcivor 1997). to make the dependent variables (habitat preferences) statistically independent of one another, we computed ratios of preferences for each habitat to preferences of every other habitat and then natural-log transformed the ratios (aitchison 1986; aebischer et al. 1993). these log ratios were then used as the dependent variables in manova (preference effect), while ﬁsh species, relative density (number of each species per tank) and their interaction comprised the independent variables. thus, the response varia- bles used in analyses were the three log ratios of each combination of habitat pairs (mud–macrophyte, mud– cobble and macrophyte–cobble) rather than the pro- portion of time spent in each of the three habitats. in this way, we were able to test two attributes (habitat preferences by ﬁshes and competition for habitat space) with a single statistical analysis. differences in habitat preferences by ﬁshes among habitats would be revealed by a signiﬁcant preference effect in the multivariate model. whether ruffe and yellow perch preferred habitats differently (e.g., in different orders) would be revealed by a signiﬁcant ﬁsh effect in the multivariate model. competition for space would be revealed by a signiﬁcant relative-density effect. when multivariate effects were signiﬁcant, we then used speciﬁc univariate results to determine where differ- ences resided for each factor, and performed contrasts if necessary. analyses were conducted separately for observations collected in light and dark. all statistical analyses were performed using systat for windows version 7.0 (spss, inc., evanston, il, usa). feeding rates experiment feeding rates of ruffe and yellow perch were deter- mined in different habitats. this experimental design was not intended to test competition for food, but speciﬁcally to test abilities of individual species to consume ruffe food in different habitats. one 3 fullerton & lamberti (7.2 ± 1.2 g), or one yellow perch (7.8 ± 1.4 g), or no ﬁsh (control) was placed into a 40-l aquarium (12.5 m2 bottom area) with one of three habitat types: (ceratophyllum; c. mud, cobble or macrophytes )2). cobble or macrophytes were placed 275 shootsæm over 2–3 cm of mud. treatments were replicated eight times during four runs. mud and macrophytes were collected from a michigan lake, and we obtained cobble from a quarry, as before. substrates were made free of large invertebrates by passing mud through a 1-mm mesh sieve and removing invertebrates from macrophytes by rinsing and picking with forceps. we then introduced into aquaria known amounts of two aquatic invertebrate types common in lakes, ‘worms’ (chironomus or lumbriculus spp.) and amphipods (gammarus or hyalella spp.). the biomass ratios of worms to amphipods were 3:1 in mud, 1:1 in cobble and 1:3 in macrophytes, representing possible ratios found in nature. chironomids and oligochaetes are the dominant taxa (by number) found in offshore mud habitats of the great lakes (fullerton et al. 1998), whereas amphipods are common in nearshore areas on cobble or macrophytes (e.g., dahl et al. 1995). each aquarium received 2.67 g wet mass of invertebrates, which provided the prey base for the duration of the experiment. this value (about 18% of body weight per ﬁsh per day) was chosen as a non-limiting food supply (fullerton et al. 2000; henson & newman 2000) from which we calculated per capita feeding rates (about 6% of body weight per ﬁsh per day). further, this areal biomass was similar to the biomass of invertebrates found naturally in ponds (hanson & leggett 1986). fish were acclimated to experimental temperatures (20 °c) in separate aquaria for 12 h before experi- ments. invertebrates were given 30 min to settle before ﬁsh were introduced. we quantiﬁed wet mass (nearest 0.1 g) of individual ﬁsh at the beginning of the experiment to normalise for ﬁsh size. after 48 h, we retrieved and weighed uneaten invertebrates and subtracted that mass from the initial mass to obtain the mass consumed. consumption by ﬁsh was corrected for partial recovery of invertebrates using controls (aquaria receiving invertebrates but not ﬁsh). one ruffe or yellow perch replicate was randomly paired (within the same experimental run) with a control replicate having the same habitat type (sensu peterson & renaud 1989), and the mass of each invertebrate type that disappeared from the control was subtracted from the treatment. using the mass consumed and the initial ﬁsh mass, we calculated daily feeding rates (gæg )1æday we used two-way analysis of variance (anova) to test whether ﬁsh species, habitat or the species · hab- itat interaction affected total consumption (consump- tion of worms and amphipods pooled). we did not examine whether these factors affected consumption of either type of invertebrate alone because each type was offered in different ratios in each habitat. how- ever, we did note the relative proportions of inverte- brates consumed in each habitat. )1). results habitat use in the light during habitat experiment a, both ﬁsh species exhibited the same preferences among habi- tats: macrophyte > cobble > mud (fig. 1;

table 1, fish). we observed substantially more movement of ruffe in the dark. ruffe continually swam around in the dark, presum- ably looking for food, whereas they remained mostly still in the light. yellow perch showed no obvious activity differences between light and dark. in habitat experiment b (with natural substrates), ruffe and yellow perch again preferred macrophytes and avoided mud and cobble in the light (fig. 1; table 1, preference). however, yellow perch used mud more than did ruffe in the light (table 1, fish), which may be an artefact of having been reared in a predator-free hatchery environment. in the dark, habitat preferences differed between ruffe and yellow perch for mud and macrophytes (table 1, fish). as in habitat experiment a, ruffe increased their use of mud habitat in the dark. this time, however, mud was preferred equally to macrophytes, such that the order of preference in habitat experiment b for ruffe in the dark was mud ¼ macrophyte > cobble (fig. 1). yel- low perch increased their use of cobble in the dark, such that preferences for mud and cobble did not differ, but both habitats were preferred signiﬁcantly less than macrophytes, as in habitat experiment a (figs 1 and 2). we again noted a large increase in the movement of ruffe in the dark but no obvious change in the activity of yellow perch. habitat preferences of ruffe and yellow perch were not affected by the presence or density of other ﬁsh (regardless of species) in either the light or dark in habitat experiment a or habitat experiment b (table 1, rd). this lack of differences suggests that ruffe and yellow perch did not compete for habitat space in the tanks. we also did not observe any direct aggression between ﬁshes of the same or different species. feeding rates total consumption of benthic macroinvertebrates by ﬁsh was marginally lower in macrophytes than in mud or cobble (f2,39 ¼ 3.182, p ¼ 0.052) (fig. 3), but did not differ between ruffe and yellow perch in any habitat (f2,39 ¼ 0.771, p ¼ 0.385). fishes consumed the two types of invertebrates in approximate propor- tion to their relative abundance in each habitat type (fig. 3, dashed line). for example, in mud where the worm:amphipod biomass ratio was 3:1, ﬁshes con- sumed three times as much biomass of worms as amphipods, consistent with supply. similarly, ﬁshes consumed biomass of amphipods and worms equally in cobble, and three times as much amphipods as worms in macrophytes, consistent with supply. discussion ruffe continue to invade new areas of as the laurentian great lakes and elsewhere in north america, the likelihood that they will either compete or coexist with yellow perch will depend on the similarities in use of resources (both habitat and food) by these ﬁshes at each life stage and the availability of these resources. coexistence between ruffe and yellow perch is possible if (i) habitat use by ﬁshes differs substantially, (ii) there is partial overlap of habitat use by ﬁshes but feeding occurs primarily in different habitats, (iii) habitat use overlap is high but ﬁshes are able to partition food resources by 5 fullerton & lamberti habitat experiment a cobble 100 2 0 80 4 0 mud 6 0 8 0 1 0 0 mud 60 c o b b l e 40 rl pd rd 20 pl 20 40 60 macrophyte 80 100 macrophyte habitat experiment b cobble 100 2 0 80 4 0 mud 6 0 8 0 rd 60 c o b b l e 40 pd 20 1 0 0 mud 20 40 60 macrophyte 80 pl rl 100 macrophyte fig. 2. ternary diagram of habitat preferences by ﬁshes in habitat experiment a (top panel), and in habitat experiment b (bottom panel): rl, ruffe in the light;

(p ¼ 0.052). dashed lines represent our experiments showed that habitat preferences of age 1+ ruffe and yellow perch were very similar in the light, but differed in the dark. given a choice of mud, cobble and macrophyte habitats, yellow perch pre- ferred macrophytes both in the light and in the dark. this outcome is consistent with ﬁeld observations that age 1+ perch generally use littoral areas, in which macrophytes are most abundant (kjellman et al. 1996; weaver et al. 1997). in our experiments, ruffe also preferred to reside in macrophytes in the light. this result was surprising because ruffe are often found in open habitat (e.g., over mud) in nature (ogle 1998), although these habitats are generally associated with turbid or deep water (up to 100 m) where light penetration is low (bergman 1991). therefore, in the clear water of our tanks, ruffe may have been using macrophyte habitat as a refuge from light because turbid or deep water was not available. in the dark, ruffe used mud and macrophytes equally. if night- active ruffe were using macrophytes as cover in the light, movement out of cover in the dark is not surprising. we did not expect such high overlap in habitat use between ﬁshes because habitats occupied by ruffe and perch in natural systems are generally different. for example, kjellman et al. (1996) found an inverse relationship between the abundance of ruffe and the density of water lillies (nuphar) in a river estuary, whereas eurasian perch abundance increased with increasing nuphar density. in europe, ruffe occur over a broader range of temperatures, light intensity and depth than do eurasian perch (bergman 1987, 1988). because of their narrower range of habitat use, perch may be more adversely affected by competition (if it occurs) than ruffe when total ﬁsh densities are high. if preferred habitats are limiting, competition for space could alter habitat use by ﬁshes. however, we saw no evidence of competition for space. habitat preferences of ruffe and yellow perch did not differ among relative-density combinations in our experi- ments. when all ﬁsh occupied macrophyte habitat, which was often, effective densities of ﬁsh approached )2, much higher than densities reported for 48 ﬁshæm ruffe or yellow perch in nature. we did not observe any direct interactions (e.g., aggression) between ﬁshes, suggesting that interference competition was unimportant. however, our experiments did not test how habitat use would be affected by competition for food or by the presence of a predator. food organisms were either not present (habitat experiment a) or present in abundance (habitat experiment b), repre- senting the endpoints of possible food abundances. if present, competition for food could force one species into a less preferred habitat food (mittelbach 1984). in search of in our experiments, habitat use by ruffe and yellow perch overlapped less in the dark than in the light. ruffe were very active and increased their use of mud habitat in the dark, but were mostly inactive during the light. because of their sensitive lateral line system and low-light adapted vision (gray & best 1989), ruffe appear to be specialised for night-time bottom feeding and generally feed when light is low (jamet & lair 1991), whereas perch feed primarily during the day (maclean & magnuson 1977; bergman 1988). ogle et al. (1995) documented diel movement of ruffe from deep water (where light is low) during the day to shallow water at night to feed. thus, ruffe may also have the potential to move from macrophytes (or other daytime habitat providing cover) to mud at night to feed. since age 1+ yellow perch feed primarily in macrophytes, this diel movement of ruffe may reduce opportunities for interspeciﬁc competition for food resources. in cases of high overlap in habitat use, as might be expected if ﬁshes both use a structurally complex habitat in the presence of a common predator (diehl & eklov 1995), the potential for competition depends on differential feeding strategies. coexistence is possible if ﬁshes prefer different prey or if they broaden their diets to include less preferred food types in the presence of the other ﬁsh species (mittelbach 1984; fullerton et al. 1998). however, evidence suggests that both species will feed on a similar range of benthic macroinvertebrates (fullerton et al. 1998; ogle 1998) at age 1+, and dieterich et al. (2004) found that neither species switched their diet from chironomids to zooplankton in the presence of interspeciﬁc competi- tors. thus, the potential for competition may depend on resource use by ruffe and yellow perch the type of habitat being used by both species and on the relative ability of ﬁshes to consume prey in that habitat. our experiment showed that the capabilities of individual ruffe and yellow perch to consume benthic invertebrates (worms and amphipods) were similar in each of three habitat types (mud, cobble and macro- phytes), and that both ﬁshes consumed prey taxa in approximate proportion to their abundance in each habitat type. the conversion of food into growth (i.e., assimilation efﬁciency) may be higher for ruffe than for perch (henson & newman 2000). feeding rates for both ﬁshes were reduced similarly in macrophytes relative to the other habitat types in our experiment, which could result in decreased energy gained by yellow perch relative to ruffe. unfortunately, our experiment was not long enough to detect changes in weight. our results suggest that neither species is innately better at consuming the types of prey offered in the habitats tested (but note that feeding rates by hatchery- reared yellow perch used in our experiments might differ from those of wild yellow perch). in addition, our experiment quantiﬁed consumption in light conditions only. in a similar set of experiments, kolar et al. (2002) found higher consumption of amphipods by yellow perch in habitat with cobbles covered in zebra mussel shells in the light, but higher consump- tion by ruffe in bare cobble habitat in the dark. however, competition for food was not tested directly in either of these studies. in a recent set of laboratory experiments, dieterich et al. (2004) found that when food supply was low, consumption of chironomids by eurasian perch decreased when ruffe were present but perch were generally better able to capture food over more complex substrates regardless of food availab- ility or presence of competitors. consumption by ruffe was higher over ﬁne sediment when food was limiting. since their introduction into lake superior two decades ago, ruffe have expanded their range into lakes huron and michigan, and have most recently established a satellite population in the little bay du noc of northern lake michigan. the probability that ruffe will affect endemic yellow perch populations as ruffe expand their range depends on whether ﬁshes use similar habitat and food resources. spatial overlap of ruffe and yellow perch in a given habitat may depend on water clarity. ruffe are not found among macro- phytes in turbid-water systems such as those in which they commonly occur in nature (lehtonen et al. 1998; sandstroem & karaas 2002), likely because macro- phytes are usually scarce under highly eutrophic conditions. macrophyte beds are expanding in the western basin of lake erie, which is relatively shallow and has clear water coincident with invasion by zebra mussels (leach 1993) and better control of nutrient inputs (hayward & margraf 1987; koonce et al. 7 fullerton & lamberti 1996). in lakes such as lake erie where water is sufﬁciently clear to allow light penetration to the bottom, ruffe may opportunistically move into macr- ophytes (or similar habitats offering cover) in the absence of alternative refuges (e.g. great depth or turbid water). as young yellow perch use macrophyte habitat extensively, and because oligotrophication may reduce the supply of benthic invertebrates, the poten- tial for competition between ruffe and yellow perch for food may be greatest in invaded lakes when both species are using macrophytes. however, competition may be minimised because perch are at least as efﬁcient as ruffe at capturing food in structurally complex habitat, and ruffe may forage in less complex habitats at night. resumen 1. la especie exo´tica gymnocephalus cernuus esta´ invadiendo a´reas de los grandes lagos de usa, ocupadas por la especie nativa perca ﬂavescens de manera que podrı´an competir por recursos de ha´bitat y alimenticios. la probabilidad de compe- ticio´ n por alimento depende, en parte, de si estos peces se sobrelapan espacial y temporalmente y tambie´n de su habilidad para consumir tipos de alimento asociados a ha´bitats dados. desarrollamos dos grupos de experimentos de laboratorio para cuantiﬁcar niveles de similitud en el uso de ha´bitat (barro, cubierta, macro´ﬁtas) y de alimento (invertebrados be´nticos). el primer conjunto de experimentos examino´ las preferencias de ha´bitat en ambas especies, la inﬂuencia de la densidad de individuos y de la presencia de alimento sobre esas preferencias y si los peces competı´an por el espacio del ha´bitat. en el segundo conjunto de experimentos cuantiﬁcamos la habilidad relativa de cada especie para consumir invertebrados be´nticos (quirono´midos, oligoquetos y anfı´podos) en tres ha´bitats distintos. 2. tanto g. cernuus and p. ﬂavescens preﬁrieron de macro´ ﬁtas a piedras y de piedras a barro en perı´odos de luz. solamente g. curnuus aumento´ el uso de barro en la oscuridad. ni la densidad de individuos ni la presencia de alimento afecto´ la seleccio´n de ha´bitat y no obtuvimos evidencia de competicio´ n por el ha´bitat. para ambas especies las tasas alimenticias fueron marginalmente menores en macro´ﬁtas que en piedras o en barro y no diﬁrieron signiﬁcativamente entre especies. 3. aunque g. cernuus y p. ﬂavescens pueden ocupar diferentes ha´bitats en la naturaleza, nuestros experimentos sugieren que si se vieran forzadas a ocupar el mismo ha´bitat (i.e., durante un proceso de invasio´n o debido a riesgo de predacio´ n), la competicio´n por el espacio seria pequen˜a o nula. sin embargo, en un ha´bitat compartido, la competicio´ n por el alimento podrı´a ocurrir cuando el alimento este´ limitado porque ninguna de las dos especies tiene una ventaja clara en su habilidad para consumir invertebrados en cualquier que sea el ha´bitat. acknowledgements we thank david lodge for insight and help with project design and analysis, susan davis, audi kiskowski,
