milner et al. 2003) and it is widely believed that density-dependent mortality during the juvenile phase is the most important endogenous mechanism of population reg- ulation in salmonids (e.g., elliott 1994; milner et al. 2003). on the other hand, failure to detect consistent stock-recruitment relationships in stream-living sal- monids led lobo´ n-cervia´ & rincon (2004) to suggest that exogenous factors and their interplay with habitat features, in particular juvenile habitat, are the domi- nant drivers of population dynamics with little or no operation of density-dependent processes. the exis- tence of multiple regulatory mechanisms in ﬁsh the role for populations population than is well accepted, but regulation other of processes doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00441.x 477 vincenzi et al. theoretical work has density-dependent survival at the larval ⁄ juvenile stage still remains very controversial (lorenzen 2008). in addition, most focused on density-dependent mechanisms that prevent a popula- tion from growing unbounded while mechanisms enhancing population resilience, i.e., a prompt recov- ery after a major population crash, have attracted less attention. density-dependent individual growth has been detected in the juvenile stage in a number of salmonid species (e.g., brown_trout salmo_trutta l., jenkins et al. 1999; lobo´ n-cervia´ 2007; atlantic salmon salmo_salar l., imre et al. 2005; for a meta-analysis of density- dependent growth in juvenile salmonids refer to grant & imre 2005). the emerging relationship between average growth rates and density of 0+ individuals is generally well described by a negative power function (e.g., grant & imre 2005). as for postjuvenile phases, utz & hartman (2009) found that adult growth and excess energy acquisition was density-dependent in brook_trout salvelinus_fontinalis, but only during periods when temperatures were warm and energy intake was low. many ecologists suggested that exploitation competi- tion for drifting prey rather than space limitation may be responsible for density-dependent individual growth (e.g., jenkins et al. 1999; imre et al. 2005). conversely, ward et al. (2007) found that competition for space also yields concave density–growth curves. whether the observed pattern is due to exploitative or interference competition or a combination of the two is still a matter of debate (ward et al. 2007). larger density-dependent individual growth may contrib- ute to population regulation at the adult stage. in fact, a tight relationship is commonly observed between body size and sexual maturation rates, egg production and spawning frequency (e.g., rose et al. 2001). as a consequence, female ﬁsh are expected to produce more eggs. moreover, if minimum body size at sexual maturity is insensitive to variation in density, time to reach sexual maturity can substantially change in response to variation of population densities affecting body size growth (rochet 1998; beverton 2002). beverton & holt (1957) acknowledged the existence of density-dependent growth in recruited ﬁsh but claimed that its importance for population regu- lation was small with respect to the other compensa- tory responses, such as density-dependent survival. however, this could be caused by an asymptotic stock- recruitment relationship where variations in body size had little effect on population dynamics. hence, the implications of density-dependent individual growth in population regulation and resilience remains little appreciated and its potential is still controversial (e.g., rose et al. 2001). natural selection for increasing lifetime reproduc- tive success shapes the life-histories of a given 478 contribution of density-dependent population in a given place, where life-histories reﬂect the expression of traits closely related to ﬁtness, such as age and size at maturity, reproductive output and the timing of the expression of these traits through the lifetime (hutchings 2003; kozlowski 2006). we could thus expect that density-dependent growth might provide an adaptive advantage in a stochastic envi- ronment with respect to a variant species that do not exhibit such a trait, i.e., whose individual growth pattern is invariant with respect to changes in popu- lation density caused by exogenous events. however, the individual growth in recruitment regulation has been little investigated in a quantitative framework in salmonids, and both observational and experimental studies have mostly focused on the detection of density-dependent individual growth at young-of-the-year in contrast, the degree to which size differences in juveniles (both intra- and inter-cohort) caused by ﬂuctuations in population density persist through the adult stage (the carry-over effect), and density-depen- dent effects on individual growth during the post- recruit phase have been scarcely investigated in freshwater ﬁshes. both empirical evidence as well experimental result for a variety of species (ﬁsh, lizards, snakes, humans, birds, etc.) show that the environmental conditions experienced early in life may affect growth of individuals through the lifetime as well as several related properties, such as metab- olism and immunocompetence (see lindstrom 1999 for a review of carry-over effects). therefore, pres- ently observed phenotypic traits may have developed through ontogenic trajectories originated in early life phases (schlichting & pigliucci 1998). stage. in a previous work, vincenzi et al. (2008a) showed that density-dependent individual growth fosters pop- ulation resilience in stream-dwelling salmonids after a population collapse caused by severe ﬂood events. in this work, we used marble trout (salmo_marmoratus) as a model system to test whether density-dependent growth can provide regulation. we explored multiple scenarios through a simulation analysis based on a demographic model of marble trout dynamics accounting for the occurrence of ﬂood events. we speciﬁcally investigated recruitment regu- lation at either high and low population densities. we also explored whether slight changes in body growth trajectories of ﬁsh could substantially alter risk of extinction and population abundance of marble trout. recruitment materials and methods we developed a data-driven individual-based model (ibm) of population dynamics of marble trout living in slovenian streams. full details are reported in vincenzi et al. (2008a) and brieﬂy described below. individual growth and recruitment dynamics of marble trout data collection data for the estimation of demographic traits of marble trout were obtained from the tag-recapture monitoring of two marble trout populations living in slovenian streams (zakojska and gorska) from 1996 to 2004 (gorska) and from 1996 to 2008 (zakojska). in this article, we report only demographic traits and com- pensatory responses of the population of zakojska. the length of zakojska is 1238 m with a pool surface of 895 m2. the annual mean precipitation from 1961 to 2007 was about 2412 ± 307 mm (mean ± sd) with october and november, the rainest months. sampling was performed every june since 1996 on the whole length of each stream. age-0 individuals were not marked as their small size in june prevented their sampling. to avoid possible negative effects of carlin tagging on small ﬁsh, only marble trout aged ‡1 and longer than 115 mm were tagged. age was determined by tag examination or, in case of ﬁrst sampling or tag loss, by reading scales. autumnal ﬂoods are a major threat to the persistence of marble trout populations living in slovenian streams, causing sudden drops in population size (vincenzi et al. 2008a). although the occurrence of ﬂoods during fall is common, the severity and frequency of ﬂoods vary greatly from year-to-year depending on the duration, frequency and intensity of rainfall. local geomorphol- ogy may also play a role in the ﬂood dynamics; brief and violent ﬂoods, which can ﬂush trout away, typically occur in high gradient constrained channels. mean ± sd number of marble trout ‡ age-1 in zakojska was 270 ± 82 between 1997 and 2007, a period during which major ﬂood events did not occur. however, the population dramatically collapsed after a severe ﬂood in november 2007 from 264 individuals in june 2007 to 11 and 15 individuals in 2008 and 2009, respectively. demographic parameters (ra) maximum likelihood estimates of survival and capture probabilities for sub-adults and adults were estimated by using the program mark (white & burnham 1999). survival probabilities sub-adults (immature ﬁsh, aged £2+) and adults (mature ﬁsh, aged ‡3+) were both density- and size-independent (vincenzi et al. 2008b). moreover, as they were estimated without considering the years following the ﬂood event in zakojska of 2007, survival proba- bilities (ra) are estimates in absence of major ﬂood events. results are reported in table 1. for vincenzi et al. (2007a) found a signiﬁcant effect of density of eggs (ed) on survival from egg to age 1 (r0) in marble trout living in slovenian streams, well described by a negative power law curve in the form: ð1þ individual growth was modelled in two alternative ways. first, we assumed that mean growth in body length can be described through a density-independent von bertalanffy model in the form: lx ¼ l1 1   e k x x0 ð r0 ¼ ae c ð2þ  d  þ where x is age (years, y) and, maximum length l¥ )1) and the age (mm), brody’s growth coefﬁcient k (y at which length equals zero x0 (y) were computed based on available data (vincenzi et al. 2007b). additionally, evidence of density-dependent indi- vidual growth was found for the marble trout popu- table 1. parameters of the individual-based model of population dynamics for the population of zakojska. in the simulations, model parameters were randomly drawn at each time step of 1 year from the uniform distribution over their respective 95% conﬁdence interval. sub-model parameter exp. value 95% ci description density-dependent ﬁrst-year survival model linear model of egg production von bertalanffy body growth model density-dependent body growth model ra a c a b l¥ k x0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 0.57 0.084 )0.75 )749.97 3.8 0.53–0.62 0.074–0.093 )0.85 to 0.65 )944.68 to )525.26 2.45–5.15 318.24 0.34 )0.34 98.49 146.94 179.47 206.44 230.44 )0.11 )0.12 )0.12 )0.12 0.10 294.69–351.27 0.27–0.41 )0.49 to )0.20 92.11–107.13 137.49–161.01 170.73–195.93 192.64–224.64 201.35–265.04 )0.16 to )0.06 )0.17 to )0.07 )0.16 to )0.07 )0.16 to )0.07 )0.18 to )0.01 adult survival constant of the power curve model of ﬁrst-year survival scaling exponent of the power curve model of ﬁrst-year survival intercept of the linear model of egg production slope of the linear model of egg production asymptotic length brody’s coefﬁcient age at which length is equal to 0 age-speciﬁc constants of the power curve model of density-dependent growth age-speciﬁc scaling exponents of the power curve model of density-dependent growth 479 vincenzi et al. lations (vincenzi et al. 2007b, 2008a). the mean length of the individuals of a cohort at age 1 . . . 5ðl1 . . . l5þ was negatively correlated with total density of marble trout aged ‡1 across the whole stream when the cohort was in its ﬁrst year of life (du, overall population density experienced as underyear- lings), clear evidence of a carry-over effect of early density (and early growth) on mean growth of the cohort through the lifetime. therefore, the relationship between population density and expected mean indi- vidual length of ﬁsh in a cohort was described by an age-speciﬁc negative power curves in the form: u lx ¼ cxd dx ð3þ where the scaling factor dx and the constant cx were estimated for each age class x ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 5 on the available data. in contrast, our ﬁeld data suggest that density at age x has no inﬂuence on body growth from age x to x + 1 when x ‡ 1 (vincenzi et al. 2008b). as no ﬁeld data were available on egg production, we relied on experiments performed in ﬁsh farm (tolm- inka, vincenzi et al. 2008c) on s. marmoratus to study the relationship between body size and number of eggs produced. model selection using aic showed that the number of eggs produced by marble trout e is related to total length l of female by the linear relationship: e ¼ a þ bl ð4þ minimum and maximum age for spawning for marble trout females living in slovenian streams was 3+ and 5+, respectively. all females aged 3 and 4 and exceeding 200 mm spawned successfully. approximately 20% of marble trout females aged 5 spawned successfully, with spawning probability being independent of body length (meldgaard et al. 2007). in the marble trout population of zakojska, egg size is not related to body size (simone vincenzi, unpublished data). the model of population dynamics demographic parameters reported in table 1 were used to design an ibm of population dynamics with a time step of 1 year incorporating both environmental and demographic stochasticity. values of parameters included in the model of population dynamics were randomly drawn at each time step from the uniform distribution over respective 95% conﬁdence interval (table 1), except for parameters of the growth models. their the number of marble trout in each age class was x ¼ 1; 2; :::; 5 ð5þ 8< : computed as follows:   nxþ1;tþ1 ¼ rxðtþnx;t  n1;tþ1 ¼ r0 t; ed;t ed;t 480 early survival r0 was estimated by using eq. (1), while annual survival of marble trout aged ‡1 was randomly drawn at each time step from the uniform distribution over the 95% conﬁdence interval. ber- noulli trials were run to deﬁne if marble trout survived or died. the number of eggs produced by female trout (sex ratio was assumed to be 1:1) was computed by using eq. (4). females were assumed to reach sexual maturity at age 3 and 4 when their length l exceeded 200 mm; 20% of females were sexually mature at age 5, independent of body length (meldgaard et al. 2007). the effect of ﬂoods on population size was simulated through a simple nonlinear fuzzy function linking october rainfall to a ﬂood-induced mortality factor f that speciﬁes the reduction in population size (%) induced by a ﬂood event, ranging between 0 for low discharges to 70% (fmax) for major ﬂood events (the fuzzy function is fully described in vincenzi et al. 2008b). in fact, october ﬂoods clearly proved to be a major threat to the viability of marble trout population in the study area: since 1993, three of eleven populations living in the study area went extinct after the impact of severe ﬂood events occurred in autumn months. stream discharge during the emergence period (april–may) seem to have a moderate inﬂuence on juvenile survival (vincenzi et al. 2007a). the effects of ﬂoods on population size was computed as follows: ﬁrst, we drew at each time step a rainfall value from the log-normal distribution of october rainfalls recorded from 1961 to 2007 in the study area, then we used the fuzzy function to derive the corresponding mortality (vincenzi et al. 2008b), which allowed us to compute the resulting population size. simulation scenarios we used the model to explore the recruitment dynamics, population persistence and recovery under two alternative hypotheses, i.e.; mean density-inde- pendent growth trajectories (di) and density-depen- dent individual growth (dd). in dd scenario, we used eq. (3) to derive the mean individual length lx of trout aged x and actual length of each individual was then randomly drawn from a log-normal distribution with mean loglx and standard deviation equal to the mean of the standard deviations of the lognormal distributions ﬁtted on cohort-speciﬁc lx data (vincenzi et al. 2007a). in di scenario, the growth of each individual trout was computed with eq. (2) by assuming von bertalanffy growth, with growth parameters l¥, k and x0 randomly drawn for each individual from the uniform distribution over their respective 95% conﬁdence intervals (table 1) and kept constant through marble trout lifetime. we note that in the absence of environmental stochasticity (i.e., constant model parameters), the two alternative growth models (i.e., dd and di growth) yield the same population abundance at quasi-stable equilib- rium which is very similar to the mean abundance observed in zakojska between 1997 and 2007, a period in which no major ﬂood event occurred (vincenzi et al. 2008a). we then used the model to assess whether slight variations in the growth trajectories of ﬁsh may inﬂuence egg production and, ultimately, population size, despite the bottleneck provided by density- dependent early survival. speciﬁcally, we ran a set of simulations to explore the demographic conse- quences of a ±5% change in mean length-at-age in the case of a density-independent von bertalanffy growth model (scenarios di)5% and di+5%, respectively). the ibm was run for the population of zakojska for 1000 replicates of 100 years each for each of the four scenarios, i.e., dd, di, di)5% and di+5%. initial population size was set to 500 age-1 individuals. for each replicate, a set of demographic indexes was computed to evaluate population performances, in particular: (i) extinction risk, that is the percentage of simulations in which population abundance dropped below the 30 individual minimum number of marble trout observed in a viable populations (dusan jesensek, personal communication) during simulation time; (ii) mean adult population abundance across the simulation time, considering only the replicates in which the population did not go extinct, (iii) the mean per-capita number of eggs produced by sexually mature females, and (iv) the correlation rdd(±sd) and rdi(±sd), as the mean of the correlation r between number of eggs produced and population abundance estimated separately for each replicate of scenario dd and di, using only the replicates in which the population did not go extinct. for part (iii) we computed the per-capita mean number of eggs produced: (i) at high density, that is when population )2, as size was ‡200 individuals (density ‡ 0.22 indæm pool surface is 895 m2); (ii) 4 years after a collapse in population size (population size lower than 70 indi- viduals, density £ 0.08 indæm is when the cohort experiencing a critical low density during the ﬁrst growth period spawned for the ﬁrst time. per- capita mean number of eggs was also computed for different thresholds of population size to assess robustness of our results. )2), that results figure 1 shows sample trajectories of population dynamics with alternative modelling assumptions, namely scenario di (fig. 1a), dd (fig. 1b) and di ± 5% (fig. 1c). with density-independent individ- ual growth the number of eggs produced was propor- individual growth and recruitment dynamics of marble trout tional to population size (fig. 1a, rdi ¼ 0:56  0:13, p < 0.05 for each replicate), while with density- dependent individual growth (fig. 1b) the correlation between the number of eggs produced and population size was lower (rdd ¼ 0:38  0:10, p < 0.05 for each replicate). as shown in fig. 2a, density-dependent growth reduced the risk of population extinction (scenario dd), with respect to a scenario in which individual growth was density-independent and fol- lowed the mean body growth trajectories estimated in the study area for marble trout (scenario di). slight variations in the mean body growth trajectories were sufﬁcient to substantially decrease or increase (sce- nario di+5% and scenario di)5%, respectively) the risk of extinction (fig. 2a), but overall the lowest risk of extinction was given by the scenario with density- dependent growth. mean population size was higher when growth was density-dependent (fig. 2b). the highest mean per-capita egg production at high densities was provided by scenario di+%5, while 4 years after the occurrence of a severe ﬂood events, the mean per capita egg production was higher with scenario dd (fig. 2c). discussion the results of our simulation analyses show that variation in individual growth contributes to the recruitment dynamics of resident salmonid marble trout. in particular, density-dependent individual growth may allow a faster recovery after population collapses due to severe disturbance events (fig. 2a) by trigger- ing the following chain of direct and indirect impacts (fig. 3): ﬁrst, severe ﬂoods remarkably reduce popu- lation abundance by ﬂushing away or killing ﬁsh. then, the individual growth rate of emerging cohorts increases due to a decreased density-dependent pressure. females mature faster and produce more eggs, as both sexual maturity and per-capita egg production are size-dependent (fig. 2c). the increased fertility and the relaxation of density-dependent ﬁrst- year survival allow the surviving population to recover faster, thus reducing the risk of extinction. in zakojska an increase in body length of marble trout aged 1 was observed after the ﬂood event of november 2007 (112.68 ± 13.16 in 2007, 129 ± 20.24 in 2008), and it will likely play a role in the possible recovery of the population. while a slight increase in length-at-age is sufﬁcient to dramatically increase (scenario di+5%) or decrease (scenario di)5%) the number of eggs produced, the mean per-capita egg production 4 years after a population collapse caused by a ﬂood event is greater in the dd scenario (fig. 2c) than in any of the di cases analysed in this study. these results suggest that slight changes in individual growth at low population densities allow an increase in recruitment 481 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 year 1500 1000 500 0 100 1500 1000 500 1 — 0 1 * d e c u d o r p s g g e f o r e b m u n 1 — 0 1 * d e c u d o r p s g g e f o r e b m u n vincenzi et al. 300 (a) t u o r t l e b r a m f o r e b m u n 200 100 0 10 300 (b) 200 100 0 10 300 (c) 200 100 0 10 t u o r t l e b r a m f o r e b m u n t u o r t l e b r a m f o r e b m u n 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 100 year di—5% di+5% 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 year fig. 1. sample trajectories of population dynamics of marble trout with different model assumptions: (a) von bertalanffy growth scenario (di);

(1999) pointed out that high individual growth rates at low densities may theoretically enable stream-dwelling salmonid populations to rebound quickly after catastrophic density-independent mortal- ity events, such as extreme ﬂoods caused by snow-melt peaks or ice dams dewatering stream reaches, through an increase in egg production and a relaxation of density-dependent early survival. also, in an atlantic salmon population living in the sawmill river, a localised massive ﬂood event provided greater growth opportunities for the surviving individuals by drasti- cally reducing competitors. the relaxed intra-speciﬁc pressure induced higher maturation rates (74% of 0+ individuals mature the year after the ﬂood vs. 5% before the ﬂood) leading to a fast recovery of the population to pre-event levels (letcher & terrick 1998). while it is intuitive that large variations in body size may have a substantial effect on fecundity and 482 0 1 . 8 . 0 6 0 . 4 . 0 2 0 . 0 0 2 0 8 1 0 6 1 0 4 1 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 5 1 0 0 1 0 5 n o i t c n i t x e f o y t i l i b a b o r p l i e z s n o i t a u p o p n a e m d e c u d o r p s g g e f o r e b m u n  a t i p a c - r e p  n a e m dd di di—5% di+5% (b) dd di di—5% di+5% (c) dd di di—5% di+5% low density high density population size, here we showed that even slight variations in mean body growth trajectories were sufﬁcient to remarkably increase or decrease (scenario (a) individual growth and recruitment dynamics of marble trout fig. 2.

(1997) showed in an experimental setting the long-lasting effect of early experience in atlantic salmon. fish with a common genetic background reared as juveniles either naturally in the river or artiﬁcially in a hatchery (sea ranched), and then allowed to grow to maturity naturally in the ocean, showed different reproductive performance at maturity, with wild individuals investment 483 vincenzi et al. population at carrying capacity population recovery flood event increased sexual maturation rates and per-capita egg production population extinction population collapses, but few individuals survive increased growth rates of juveniles relaxation of density- dependent pressure (first- year survival and body growth) the better reproductive perfor- displaying higher mances. fleming et al. (1997) concluded that early experience affects the development of specialised skills and traits important also for later life. jonsson et al. (1996) reported that juvenile growth explained part of the variation in number of eggs produced by atlantic salmon. for brown_trout, lobo´ n-cervia´ et al. (1997) found that the number of eggs produced by females aged 1+ was determined when trout were still 0+ (esva river, spain). lobo´n-cervia´ (2005) found a negative power relationship between initial cohort size and lifetime growth in weight of the same cohort (rio chaballos, spain). alvarez et al. (2006) found that temperature during the yolk-absorptive stage can shape the evolution of metabolic rate and later growth performance in brown_trout. the analyses performed in the present work are based on a demographic model with parameters calibrated on the data available for marble trout in zakojska, slovenia. some of model parameters – such as a linear relationship between body length and number of eggs produced or the absence of maternal effect on egg size – represent observed patterns for the marble trout population of zakojska, but due to local adaptations those patterns may be slightly different even in other marble trout populations living in the same general region. in several salmonids, the number of eggs produced increases linearly or more than linearly with body weight which, in turn is almost ubiquitously proportional to the cube of body length (wootton 1998). in addition, it has been observed that larger females may also produce larger and more viable eggs (wootton 1998). we thus wondered whether our conclusions on the role of density- dependent body size would still hold true in the case of alternative assumptions on the relationship between length and number of eggs produced and maternal effect on eggs survival. accordingly, we ran further 484 fig. 3. occurrence of a severe ﬂood event, increase of individual body growth rates and consequent recruitment dynamics in marble trout. the relaxation of density-dependent ﬁrst year survival and density-dependent growth increases recruitment in the years following the population collapse. for larger simulations for hypothetical marble trout populations in which – all the other parameters being equal – the relationship between body length and per capita egg production is a power curve with exponent close to three (wootton 1998), or egg survival is slightly greater females. the alternative model parameters were tuned to provide the same population size at quasi-stable equilibrium in the absence of environmental variability, i.e., about 270 individuals. results of the simulations (not reported here) under variable environment with a power curve relationship between length of female and fecundity or maternal effects on eggs survival are consistent with the main conclusions of the present work, i.e., that density- dependent individual growth increases resilience to ﬂood events and helps regulate recruitment in marble trout in recruitment dynamics. in the marble trout of zakojska, we did not ﬁnd strong evidence in favour of compensatory body growth after the ﬁrst year of life, but its role in the recruitment dynamics deserves further investigations. in fact, while compensatory body growth was scarcely observed in marble trout, taxonomically close species may have different propensities to show compensatory responses (ali et al. 2003). in addition, the costs and beneﬁts of fast growth may be context-dependent, including effects of previous growth history, i.e., how quickly individuals have grown in the past (carlson et al. 2004). selection on growth may also depend on the overall pattern of growth in the population. in general, compensatory growth may require more risky foraging strategies and increase the mortality of small individuals growing fast (damsgard & dill 1998), but in a population of brown_trout, carlson et al. (2004) found that mortality decreased for individuals exhib- iting fast growth, thus reinforcing the context- and species-dependent propensity to show compensatory growth later in life. individual growth and recruitment dynamics of marble trout obviously, other factors contribute to regulating and inﬂuencing population size in stream-dwelling salmo- nids and thus limit the generality of the results of our simulation analysis. a reduction in cannibalism may in part explain the spike in juveniles commonly observed after severe ﬂood events in salmonid pop- ulations. it is generally recognised that cannibalism may contribute to stabilisation population numbers (dong & polis 1992) and alter size distributions (crowley & hopper 1994). in marble trout cannibal- ism has been observed (dusan jesensek, personal communication) and further investigation is needed to assess its role in marble trout recruitment dynamics. environmental factors such as stream discharge can modify suitable habitat for ﬁsh and alter spawning grounds and thus inﬂuence the overall reproductive output and population size (lobo´ n-cervia´ & rincon 2004). the striking contrast of closely related salmo- nid species in age and size at maturity, semelparity versus iteroparity, egg size versus number, shape of size-fecundity relationship, life-histories and breeding tactics (hendry & stearns 2004) may hinder general- isations on the implications of density-dependent individual growth on compensatory recruitment. fur- ther observational data that will be available in the future for other marble populations living in the same region will be used to extensively validate model results. moreover, it will be worth investigating the consequences of different trade-offs between mortality and body growth in density-dependent growth sce- nario. while density-dependent early survival is generally recognised as an important mechanism of population regulation and the role of environmental factors in inﬂuencing population size is widely acknowledged, further investigations on the implica- tions of density-dependent individual growth in pop- ulation dynamics are greatly encouraged. acknowledgements we thank fondation sansouire and the angling association of tolmin for funding this study. all the people who have participated to the ﬁeldwork are warmly thanked. the authors are also grateful to three anonymous referees and to will satterthwaite for insightful and constructive suggestions. references ali, m., nicieza, a. & wootton, r.j. 2003. compensatory growth in ﬁshes: a response to growth depression. fish & fisheries 4: 147–190. alvarez, d., cano, j.m. & nicieza, a.g. 2006. microgeo- graphic variation in metabolic rate and energy storage of brown_trout: countergradient selection or thermal sensitivity? evolutionary ecology 20: 345–363. beverton, r.j.h. 2002. fish population biology and ﬁsheries in: anderson, e.d., ed. the raymond j. h. research. beverton lectures at woods hole. massachusetts: u.s. department of commerce, pp. 61–106. noaa tech. memo. nmfs-f ⁄ spo-5. beverton, r.j.h. & holt, s.j. 1957. on the dynamics of exploited ﬁsh populations. london: chapman & hall. carlson, s.m., hendry, a.p. & letcher, b.h. 2004. natural selection acting on body size, growth rate and compensatory growth: an empirical in a wild trout population. evolutionary ecology research 6: 955–973. test crowley, p.h. & hopper, k.r. 1994. how to behave around cannibals: a density-dependent dynamic game. american naturalist 143: 117–154. damsgard, b. & dill, l.m. 1998. risk-taking behavior in weight-compensating coho salmon, oncorhynchus_kisutch. behavioral ecology 9: 26–32. dong, q. & polis, g.a. 1992. the dynamics of cannibalistic populations: a foraging perspective. in: elgar, m.a. & crespi, b.j., eds. cannibalism: ecology and evolution among diverse taxa. oxford: oxford university press, pp. 13–37. elliott, j.a. 1994. quantitative ecology and the brown_trout. oxford: oxford university press. fleming, i.a., lamberg, a. & jonsson, b. 1997. effects of early experience on the reproductive performance of atlantic salmon. behavioral ecology 8: 470–480. grant, j.w.a. & imre, i. 2005. patterns of density-dependent growth in juvenile stream-dwelling salmonids. journal of fish biology 67: 100–110. hendry, a.p. & stearns, s.c.
