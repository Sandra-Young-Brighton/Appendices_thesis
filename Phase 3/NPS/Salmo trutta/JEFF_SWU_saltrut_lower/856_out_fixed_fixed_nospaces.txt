(2007), who collected alewife in 10 m of water on the eastern side of lake michigan, there is minimal information on recent feeding patterns of alewife in shallow nearshore waters where interactions with other species can be intensiﬁed owing to higher ﬁsh densities. moreover, nearshore areas provide life- stage-speciﬁc critical habitats for ﬁsh spawning and nursery during summer (e.g., alewife, yellow perch, perca ﬂavescens or spottail shiner, notropis hudso- nius) (wells & house 1974; dufour et al. 2005; creque et al. 2010). despite alewife, yellow perch and spottail shiner dominating the nearshore community in the recent decades (pothoven et al. 2000; janssen & luebke 2004; truemper et al. 2006), their competitive interactions were relatively overlooked in the great lakes. yellow perch is an ecologically and economically important native species, whose abundance was greatly reduced in the late 1990s (madenjian et al. 2002; marsden & robillard 2004). despite concerted management efforts, yellow perch population levels remain at historically low levels, with erratic and generally low recruitment (clapp & dettmers 2004). yellow perch has a strong nearshore association, especially during its juvenile stages, where it beneﬁts from feeding on benthic invertebrates to help ensure fast growth before winter months. despite this seem- ingly critical period in yellow perch life history, most diet studies of yellow perch in the great lakes focus only on larger ﬁsh (wells 1980; hayward & margraf 1987; tyson & knight 2001; truemper et al. 2006) or do not examine age-0 and age-1 ﬁsh caught during the same time periods (pothoven et al. 2000). it may be of critical importance to explore diets of young yellow perch when they occupy nearshore regions to better understand the degree of competition with other species during the time they feed in preparation for overwintering. ontogenetic diet shifts are exhibited by juvenile forms of many ﬁsh species and allow individuals to optimise foraging success as their preferred prey type and size changes with rapid growth during early life stages. for example, as yellow perch grow, they 208 transition from feeding on zooplankton to benthic invertebrates at 40–60 mm total length and ﬁnally switch to ﬁsh when they reach about 140 mm (clady 1974). thus, interspeciﬁc competitive interactions can change as ontogenetic diet shifts occur and ﬁsh transition from one type of prey to another (keast 1978; hrabik et al. 2001). during times of low prey resources, these competitive interactions may intensify (schleuter & eckmann 2008) and, to a large extent, may contribute to growth patterns of competing cohorts of one species or among individuals of different species. competitive interactions are often intensiﬁed between species with a high degree of spatial overlap, which may lead to reduced ﬁtness of one or both species if they compete for limited resources (stewart et al. 1981). given declining zooplankton levels in the nearshore zone postdreissenids (dettmers et al. 2003) and changes in the benthic community (nalepa et al. 1998; truemper et al. 2006), it is very likely that there is a prolonged period of overlap in prey consumption by alewife, yellow perch and spottail shiner when they co-occur in nearshore habitats. age-0 and age-1 yellow perch diets have been dominated by chironomids, along with zooplankton, amphipods, ﬁsh, isopods and mysis (pothoven et al. 2000; janssen & luebke 2004; truemper et al. 2006). spottail shiners were reported to consume chironomid larvae along with zooplankton, sphaeriids and ﬁsh eggs in shallow (5–18 m) areas of lake michigan, while in deeper waters (18–31 m), they fed primarily on the burrowing amphipod diporeia (wells 1980). another study in little bay de noc, lake michigan, found spottail shiners to consume a variety of aquatic insects, zooplankton, hydracarnia, oligochaetes, ﬁsh eggs and algae (basch 1968). despite occurrence of chironomids and other benthic prey, such as diporeia, in alewife diets through the years (webb & mccomish 1974; janssen & luebke 2004; pothoven & madenjian 2008), no one has documented recent trophic interac- tions between yellow perch, alewife and spottail shiners in shallow coastal waters of lake michigan. given the plethora of food web research in lake michigan, competitive interactions of ﬁsh in the nearshore areas are seldom addressed. although diet overlap and consequently competition for food often occur between cohorts of the same species, studies addressing this dynamic, especially in a temporal context, are relatively rare. herein, we attempted to ﬁll this missing gap in nearshore studies. using a recent (2000–2007) data set of zooplankton, benthic inver- tebrates and common ﬁsh covering multiple seasons in shallow water (<10 m), we explored feeding ecology of yellow perch, alewife and spottail shiner in the nearshore area of southwestern lake michigan. our objectives were to (i) test whether prey composition varied over time (year and season), (ii) test whether ﬁsh diets changed over time (season and year) and (iii) evaluate the degree of interspeciﬁc diet overlap (yellow perch, alewife and spottail shiner) as well as intraspeciﬁc diet similarity (within species size classes). methods biological sampling we sampled ﬁsh at two ﬁxed sites in the illinois waters of lake michigan from late july through october during 2000–2007. both sites are characterised by a sand substrate; site dr is located 3.7 km north of waukegan harbor at the mouth of the dead river, while site wh is located just north of waukegan harbor (fig. 1). samples were taken weekly at site wh and biweekly at site dr depending on weather conditions. sampling was performed with a bottom trawl (4.9-m headrope, 38-mm stretch mesh body, and 13-mm mesh cod end liner) towed for a distance of 0.9 km (4460 m2 of bottom swept) at a speed of approximately 2.5–3.0 knots along the 3-, 5-, 7.5- and 10-m depth contours. all ﬁsh were identiﬁed, mea- sured and enumerated in the ﬁeld. subsamples of up to 30 alewife, yellow perch and spottail shiner from each trawl were immediately frozen for stomach analysis. diet overlap in nearshore lake michigan concurrent with bottom trawl sampling, two zoo- plankton samples were taken at 10 m depths using a 63-lm mesh and 0.5-m-diameter plankton net towed vertically from 0.5 m above the bottom to the surface. samples were stored immediately in 5% sugar forma- lin. in the laboratory, samples were processed by examining three 5-ml subsamples, taken from adjusted volumes that provided a count of at least 20 individ- uals of the most dominant taxa. zooplankton were enumerated and identiﬁed into the following catego- ries: cyclopoid copepodites, calanoid copepodites, copepod nauplii, rotifers, cladocerans to genus (daph- nia to species), macrothrididae spp., sididae spp. and dreissena sp. veligers. scuba (self-contained underwater breathing appa- ratus) divers collected benthic invertebrates once a month at the 7.5 m depth at each site using a 7.5-cm- diameter core sampler. four replicate samples from the top 7.5 cm of soft substrate were collected and preserved in 95% ethanol (fullerton et al. 1998). in the laboratory, benthic core samples were sieved through 500-lm screens to remove sand, and organ- isms were sorted from the remaining sediment debris. organisms were identiﬁed to the lowest practicable level, typically to genus; total length (mm) and head capsule width (chironomidae) were measured for each individual. all taxa were enumerated, and total density estimates were calculated as the mean of all sample replicates. diet processing in the stomachs were fish were thawed and measured for mass (g) and length (mm), and intact stomachs were removed and stored in 95% ethanol until diet processing. diets of preserved ﬁsh were analysed using a dissecting microscope; prey taxa were identiﬁed to the lowest practical level depending on degree of digestion. all organisms counted; digested ⁄ partial prey was counted using head capsules or bodies with heads ⁄ eyes. in the cases of large numbers of zooplankton prey, any large organisms were counted, and the remaining stomach contents were then diluted with a known volume of water (10– 30 ml) and subsampled (3–1 ml aliquots or until 100 of a species counted) to estimate number of zooplank- ton prey present. up to 20 intact organisms of each prey taxa were measured to the nearest 0.01 mm using a digitising tablet and imagej software (rasband, w.s., image j, u.s. national institutes of health, bethesda, md, usa, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). dry weight biomass (mg) was calculated for each measured prey item using length–weight conversion equations or average weights from the literature (dumont et al. 1975; hawkins & evans 1979; wid- bom 1984; culver et al. 1985; dermott et al. 1993; 209 fig. 1. map of southwestern lake michigan with sampling areas indicated by solid triangles [(dead river (dr) and waukegan harbor (wh)]. creque & czesny sprung 1993; burkhardt 1994; haugen & rygg 1996; benke et al. 1999; ojaveer et al. 2001). from these results, average biomass for each prey group was calculated by ﬁsh species, size class and season and applied to estimate biomass of unmeasured prey items. estimated total stomach dry weight was used to calculate the percentage composition (by weight) of each prey group for each individual stomach; there were 27 main prey groups identiﬁed. stomachs with both one item present and a total dry weight <0.05 mg were not included in analysis. rare prey groups (occurring in <1% of ﬁsh) with the exception of ﬁsh prey were combined to give a total of 23 prey groups for analysis. cercopagidae spines were included as a 24th group in frequency of occurrence analysis but were not used in stomach biomass analyses. data analysis large alewife, for bottom trawl catch data and diet analysis, data were pooled for all depths and locations. the three most commonly caught ﬁsh species in bottom trawls were divided into ﬁve groups based on size: small alewife, small yellow perch, large yellow perch and spottail shiners. fish >160 mm were excluded from analyses. in late july and august, ﬁsh ‡70 mm were classiﬁed as large; in september and october, ﬁsh ‡80 mm were classiﬁed as large. these designations were based on length and weight fre- quency histograms from our data and length at age information in the literature and provide the most accurate available approximation of the age-0 and age- 1+ cohorts. however, for the purposes of this study, than age classes appear more size classes rather appropriate given that the growth of both alewife and yellow perch has changed over our study period (fitzgerald et al. 2004; headley & lauer 2008; o’gorman et al. 2008) and actual size rather than age will determine prey selection and consumption. spottail shiners were lumped together because of their low sample number and presence of very few small ﬁsh; in addition, wells (1980) showed similarity in spottail diet regardless of size. to explore seasonal patterns, samples were also classiﬁed based on collection date: summer (29 july – 14 september) and fall (15 september – 31 october). pearson’s correlations were run using natural log– transformed cpue (catch per unit effort) of individual trawls to test for relationships between abundance of the ﬁve ﬁsh groups. results for pearson’s correlations are presented with a lower case ‘r’ in the text. for zooplankton and benthic invertebrate sampling, data were also pooled for all depths and locations. percentage composition by number was calculated for 15 zooplankton taxa and nine benthic invertebrate taxa for each individual sample and then averaged by 210 season and year to use in multivariate analysis of changes in the prey community over time. to summarise diet data for all ﬁsh groups and seasons, frequency of occurrence and mean percentage dry weight for each prey group were calculated for all ﬁsh with prey items present in the stomach. frequency of occurrence for each prey group represents percent- age of stomachs with at least one such prey item. percentage weight for each prey group was calculated for individual ﬁsh and averaged across all stomachs within each ﬁsh group ⁄ season. multivariate diet analysis to evaluate diet similarity and overlap among our ﬁve ﬁsh groups, the mean percentage composition by dry weight for each prey group was calculated for each ﬁsh group, season and year combination. wallace (1981) noted that percentage weight is the most appropriate (least objectionable) diet measure for calculating overlap. these results were imported into primer-e software (clarke & gorley 2006) for mul- tivariate analysis: ﬁsh groups were treated as samples and prey groups as variables. square-root transforma- tion was performed, and data were converted to a bray–curtis matrix for analysis. for delineation of diet resemblance, we conducted analysis of similarity (anosim), group-average hierarchical cluster analy- sis, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nmds) and similarity percentages (simper) methods (clarke & warwick 2001). we also calculated schoener’s over- lap index (schoener 1970) on summer and fall diet data as a complementary analysis to anosim; for schoener’s index, overlap was considered to be biologically meaningful with values >0.6 (zaret & rand 1971). anosim and nmds were also used to evaluate similarity of the prey community by season and year using mean percentage composition by number. that test statistic (r) analysis of similarity is based on rank similarities between samples in the bray–curtis matrix and computes a global reﬂects observed differences between sample groups (in this study, ﬁsh, year and season) compared to differences between replicates within sample groups (clarke 1993). we considered pairwise r values £0.25 to represent substantial overlap ⁄ similarity, values 0.26– 0.5 indicated moderate similarity, and values >0.5 suggested little to no overlap between groups. results for anosim in the text are presented with a capital ‘r’. nmds was run in primer-e, and a 2-d represen- tation of nmds results was considered usable when stress <0.2 (clarke 1993). simper were used to identify which prey species contribute the most to diet similarity within a ﬁsh group and diet differences between ﬁsh groups. table 1. mean density of ﬁsh ±1sd (no per 100,000 m2) collected by bottom trawl during 2000–2007 at two locations near waukegan, il. diet overlap in nearshore lake michigan number of trawls large alewife small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch 65 48 52 57 60 72 50 65 627 ± 925 259 ± 441 277 ± 947 322 ± 1182 174 ± 715 246 ± 957 571 ± 2681 91 ± 293 418 ± 1032 2553 ± 8533 1047 ± 4554 768 ± 4061 130 ± 443 62 ± 296 100 ± 367 4 ± 20 538 ± 919 257 ± 582 108 ± 346 462 ± 2280 77 ± 309 43 ± 227 22 ± 54 10 ± 52 7 ± 20 9 ± 33 41 ± 280 65 ± 437 5 ± 23 106 ± 438 3 ± 12 4 ± 18 1 ± 5 21 ± 76 159 ± 811 4 ± 10 301 ± 1491 1506 ± 5780 470 ± 1505 26 ± 56 year 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 results temporal patterns in nearshore ﬁsh densities a total of 469 bottom trawl tows (269 in summer and 185 in fall) were conducted at two ﬁxed locations during 2000–2007 (table 1). abundance of large alewife ﬂuctuated little through the years; annual cpue ranged from 174 to 627 ﬁsh per 100,000 m2, except for 2007, which had 91 ﬁsh per 100,000 m2. abundance of small alewife was highest during the years 2000–2003, with a peak in 2001, and declined at least threefold in 2004–2007. spottail shiner annual cpue exhibited a general decline from 2000 to 2007. on the other hand, annual cpue of small yellow perch generally increased from 2000 to 2004, with the exception of 2003, and peaked in 2005 with 1506 ﬁsh per 100,000 m2 (table 1). yellow perch cpue during 2007 was similar to the low numbers in 2000–2003. large yellow perch cpues were low compared to the other species and peaked in 2005 at 106 ﬁsh per 100,000 m2. pearson’s correlations for the ﬁve ﬁsh group’s cpue were generally weak, and there were no signiﬁcant negative relationships. abundances of alewife correlated (r = 0.36, p < 0.001) as were abundances of yellow perch size classes (r = 0.33, p < 0.001). spottail shiner cpue was positively related to large and small alewife abundance r = 0.37, p < 0.001 respectively). all other signiﬁcant correla- tions had r < 0.25.

global r for year in both summer (r = 0.27, p < 0.01) and fall (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) was relatively low, and the majority of pairwise test values were r < 0.3, indicating substantial to moder- ate similarity of their diets through the years. because we were most interested in overlap between ﬁsh groups rather than variation in individual diets, all ﬁsh groups’ diet data were averaged by year and season for the remaining analysis. for the means data set, there were 59 ﬁsh group, season and year combinations; 36 of these had ‡20 stomachs for analysis (table 2). diets also did not differ by year in one- and two-way anosim tests using the means data set, and thus, year was consid- ered as replicate for each season within each ﬁsh group. in a two-way crossed anosim, diets were signiﬁcantly different for both ﬁsh group (global r = 0.58, p < 0.001) and season (global r = 0.46, p < 0.001). anosim multiple comparison tests with- in ﬁsh groups indicated that diets of large and small alewife were very similar (r = 0.10) (table 3). small and large yellow perch, and large alewife and small yellow perch were the next most similar pairs (r = 0.37 and 0.37, respectively), while small alewife and spottail shiners were most dissimilar (r = 0.93). alewife consumed higher proportions of bosmini- dae in the summer, while copepods and bythotrephes table 2. number of ﬁsh stomachs with prey present in each year and season for each ﬁsh group. large alewife small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch year s f 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 total 92 39 9 31 23 10 69 94 367 33 33 4 9 5 45 129 s 34 11 3 14 3 6 11 82 f s f s f s f 125 81 38 27 37 86 394 95 17 24 20 20 176 89 44 6 8 22 169 5 2 46 3 2 58 4 118 228 320 164 39 873 25 2 7 68 305 170 24 601 30 30 4 8 72 seasons indicated by s (summer) and f (fall). table 3. r values from multiple comparison tests of the means data set in anosims with signiﬁcant global test and results calculated from schoener’s overlap index. diet overlap in nearshore lake michigan anosim schoener’s time fish large alewife small alewife spottail shiner all seasons summer fall small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch 0.10 0.71 0.68 0.37 0.06 0.62 0.66 0.26 0.16 0.87 0.72 0.50 0.93 0.87 0.64 0.89 0.82 0.47 0.99 0.93 0.82 0.64 0.91 0.43 0.99 0.80 0.84 r values that had a signiﬁcance level above 5% are bolded. anosim, analysis of similarity. large yellow perch 0.37 0.72 0.14 large alewife small alewife spottail shiner 0.67 0.30 0.29 0.54 0.71 0.34 0.30 0.54 0.73 0.16 0.20 0.36 0.15 0.14 0.37 0.26 0.23 0.46 0.13 0.11 0.29 0.54 0.46 0.74 0.57 0.19 0.27 large yellow perch 0.63 0.53 0.70 table 4. frequency of occurrence (% of ﬁsh consuming that prey item) and mean percentage composition by dry weight (value in parentheses) for ﬁsh collected in summer (s) and fall (f). large alewife small alewife spottail shiner large yellow perch small yellow perch prey group s f s f s f s f s f benthic invertebrates amphipod chironomid larvae chironomid pupa dreissenid isopod gastropod ostracod sphaeriidae other invrt zooplankton bosminidae bythotrephes calanoid cercopagis chydoridae cyclopoid copepod (unk) daphnidae harpacticoid polyphemidae other cladocera other zooplankton veliger other fish prey spines 2 (1) 48 (22) 19 (6) 12 (1) 0 1 (0) 11 (1) 2 (0) 9 (2) 78 (31) 1 (0) 23 (5) 9 (2) 37 (6) 13 (1) 30 (5) 14 (3) 30 (1) 2 (0) 13 (0) 1 (0) 41 (13) 17 (9) 17 (3) 2 (0) 10 (1) 0 0 2 (0) 1 (0) 7 (0) 78 (14) 23 (14) 37 (3) 12 (1) 12 (2) 15 (1) 68 (40) 16 (5) 9 (0) 6 (0) 24 (3) 5 (0) 7 (1) 4 (1) 44 (17) 12 (3) 4 (0) 0 0 12 (1) 2 (0) 4 (2) 94 (51) 0 27 (3) 0 21 (1) 22 (1) 55 (11) 6 (5) 43 (0) 0 9 (3) 7 (1) 40 (4) 2 (1) 19 (9) 1 (0) 2 (0) 0 0 4 (0) 1 (0) 2 (0) 91 (22) 3 (1) 38 (5) 0 7 (1) 10 (3) 80 (48) 23 (3) 16 (0) 1 (0) 29 (3) 11 (2) 11 (1) 17 (7) 80 (59) 27 (10) 42 (14) 0 18 (3) 13 (1) 8 (0) 21 (5) 3 (0) 1 (0) 1 (0) 1 (1) 16 (1) 1 (0) 0 0 5 (0) 0 0 0 11 (0) <1 (0) 18 0 34 1 (0) 5 <1 (0) 3 0 0 32 (11) 71 (45) 2 (1) 61 (37) 0 12 (1) 6 (1) 5 (0) 15 (3) 4 (0) 5 (1) 1 (0) 1 (0) 2 (0) 0 2 (0) 0 4 (1) 0 1 (0) 2 (1) 15 (0) 2 (1) 2 36 (22) 97 (65) 64 (7) 4 (0) 4 (2) 4 (0) 17 (0) 1 (0) 11 (1) 3 (0) 0 13 (0) 0 17 (0) 11 (0) 10 (0) 0 6 (0) 0 0 0 (1) 0 6 (3) 0 86 (78) 47 (7) 21 (4) 2 (0) 9 (3) 0 5 (0) 4 (0) 4 (0) 4 (0) 10 (7) 5 (0) 5 (0) 4 (0) 0 10 (1) 2 (0) 7 (0) 0 2 (0) 0 0 0 0 9 (5) 62 (39) 43 (20) 1 (0) 1 (0) 0 3 (0) 0 3 (0) 48 (6) 1 (1) 43 (7) 3 (1) 57 (4) 24 (1) 57 (12) 14 (2) 28 (1) 6 (0) 9 (1) 1 (0) 8 (0) <1 (0) <1 (0) 62 (51) 44 (14) 14 (5) 5 (0) 7 (1) <1 (0) 5 (0) 1 (0) 4 (1) 12 (0) 11 (7) 46 (8) 6 (1) 12 (0) 21 (1) 44 (8) 14 (3) 18 (0) <1 (0) 5 (0) <1 (0) 3 (0) <1 (0) 1 (0) mean percentage dry weight is reported as zero if the value was <0.5%. were eaten at higher proportions in the fall (table 4). large yellow perch summer diets were primarily chironomid larvae, while their fall diets were primarily amphipods (table 4). small yellow perch in summer consumed invertebrates and zooplankton, while in the fall, amphipods were the major component of their diets with lower frequency and percentage weight of zooplankton prey compared to summer (table 4). 213 creque & czesny alelg alesm spottail yplg ypsm 40% similarity 60% similarity (a) (c) spottail yplg ale ypsm ale (b) (d) fig. 4.

they were found in the highest percentage of ﬁsh and accounted for the largest percentage of diet by weight (table 4). chydoridae was the most universally consumed zooplankton prey in summer, with 16% of spottail shiners and up to 57% of small yellow perch eating them. more than 77% of alewife consumed bosminidae, which accounted for 31 and 51% of diet biomass for large and small alewife, respectively (table 4). small yellow perch also consumed bosminidae (48% frequency), but only a few of large yellow perch and spottail shiners did (< 3%). in summer, large yellow perch fed predom- inantly on benthic prey organisms; more than 97% of them consumed chironomid larvae, which, along with chironomid pupae and amphipods, contributed 96% by weight of mean total diet biomass. spottail shiners consumed a much higher proportion of dreissenid mussels and gastropods (total 17% by weight) com- pared to the other ﬁsh (table 4). alewife of both sizes had a higher frequency and percentage weight of veligers compared to other ﬁsh groups, and cerco- pagidae spines were found in 18% of large alewife stomachs, but almost none were found in other ﬁsh groups. diets of all ﬁsh groups shifted in the fall. a smaller proportion of small yellow perch consumed zooplank- ton taxa in fall compared to summer (table 4). on the other hand, large yellow perch consumption of zooplankton, measured in percentage composition by weight, increased in fall; this increase was primarily due to heavier feeding on copepods and bythotrephes (table 4). amphipods were the predominant prey for both yellow perch size groups during fall; frequency and percentage by weight both increased >45% more than that in summer. spottail shiner consumption of chironomid larvae was very similar to summer levels, whereas amphipod and dreissenid mussels increased in frequency and weight contribution in fall diets. bosminidae was the most frequently consumed prey by alewife during fall, but its mean percentage composition by biomass declined compared to sum- mer. during fall, copepods were the largest diet item in terms of percentage weight, accounting for 44% for large alewife and 56% for small alewife. large alewife also showed an increase in amphipod consumption and decrease in chironomid consumption during fall; only 2% of small alewife consumed amphipods (table 4). diet overlap in nearshore lake michigan for fall and small (p < 0.001) for and large samples, anosim results showed a signiﬁcant difference in mean diet composition between the 5 ﬁsh groups (global r = 0.65, p < 0.001). within species, diet overlap was signiﬁ- large cant alewife (r = 0.16) and small yellow perch (r = 0.14); results of schoener’s diet overlap index also had values of 0.73 and 0.70 for these two pairings, respectively (table 3). all other ﬁsh group comparisons showed very little diet overlap (r > 0.5). although ﬁsh groups shared many common prey taxa, proportions weight of macroinvertebrates were higher in yellow perch diets, while zooplankton proportions by weight were higher in alewife stomachs (table 4). complementing anosim results, nmds plot of fall diets also showed clear groupings by species (fig. 5a). simper analysis indicated the different prey species responsible for these distinct groupings. yellow perch diets were 55% similar, with amphipods contributing 66% to diet similarity. yellow perch and spottail shiners diets were 69% dissimilar. yellow perch consumed more amphipods, while spottail shiners consumed more chironomid larvae and dre- issenids; together, these 3 taxa contributed 57% to the dissimilarity. yellow perch and alewife diets differed by 71%, with amphipods, unknown copepods and bosminidae contributing 50% to the dissimilarity (fig. 5b–d). prey that contributed the most to the 79% diet difference between spottail shiners and alewife were unknown copepods, chironomid larvae, bosminidae and dreissenids. there were two minor exceptions to the species group patterns in nmds; large alewife in 2004 clustered with yellow perch, and yellow perch from 2007 clustered with alewife (fig. 5a). yellow perch in 2007 consumed ‡20% more zooplankton by weight than in other years, and large alewife in 2004 consumed 50% less zooplankton compared to alewife in other years. discussion despite the ongoing changes in the nearshore com- munity of lake michigan, there are very few long- term ﬁsh diet studies addressing multiple species and size classes, especially in coastal shallow waters. we examined diet and abundance trends of the most common nearshore ﬁsh along with prey abundance and composition in shallow waters of southwestern lake michigan in summer and fall over eight consec- utive years. as in other studies, our emphasis was on synthesising average diets and using these to calculate diet overlap among ﬁsh species and their size classes (keast 1977; raborn et al. 2004; sampson et al. 2009). diets of the individual ﬁsh groups were similar through the years and did not appear to be affected by 215 creque & czesny alelg alesm spottail yplg ypsm 40% similarity 60% similarity (a) (c) yp spottail ale (b) (d) fig. 5.

in ﬁsh abundance. although prey composition did not vary by season, we observed seasonal changes in general diet characteristics and patterns of intra- and interspeciﬁc diet overlap among studied ﬁsh groups. small yellow perch and large alewife had the most prevalent interspeciﬁc diet overlap, which occurred primarily in summer. alewife exhibited intraspeciﬁc overlap in both seasons, while signiﬁcant overlap between yellow perch size classes occurred only in fall. invertebrates prey composition varied little throughout the years. the only signiﬁcant change in prey composition occurred among benthic and was reﬂected in diet results. diporeia was the dominant amphipod until summer 2006, but none have been collected since. consequently, yellow perch diets in 2007 were markedly different from all other years. although there were moderate densities of other amphipods (those besides diporeia) in fall 2007, amphipods did not signiﬁcantly contribute to either 216 large or small yellow perch diets that year. this further indicates yellow perch have a preference for diporeia over other amphipods. if diporeia abundances con- tinue to collapse in illinois waters, as seen on the eastern side of lake michigan (nalepa et al. 1998; madenjian et al. 2002), it could have a severe impact on age-0 yellow perch. alewife exhibited declining growth and energy density following a dreissenidae- induced diporeia decline in eastern lake michigan (madenjian et al. 2003); the same patterns could be seen in yellow perch in upcoming years. the abundance estimates of ﬁsh groups based on bottom trawl catches were not highly correlated, and the large variances of our data may have obscured the ability to detect statistical relationships. this high intra-annual variability may be an artefact of gear efﬁciency; however, we are conﬁdent that our mean abundance values are representative of changes in ﬁsh stocks through the years because the same general patterns for alewife and yellow perch abundance were observed in surveys by other agencies at locations throughout lake michigan (madenjian et al. 2008b; makauskas & clapp 2010). because diet patterns were statistically similar through all years, changing ﬁsh densities did not appear to have an impact on their feeding patterns. the exception to this general obser- vation being in fall of 2001 and 2002, when densities of small alewife were at their highest likely forcing small yellow perch to feed almost exclusively on benthos (99% by weight). conversely, when small alewives were at lower abundances in 2003–2006, small yellow perch diets were comprised of higher zooplankton percentage by weight (8–35%). more- over, in 2007 when densities of both alewife sizes were at the lowest levels in our study period, small yellow perch consumed up to 54% zooplankton by weight. such a shift in small yellow perch diet was likely a result of relatively weak competitive pressure owing to low alewife abundance and lack of diporeia as an alternative prey. the most noticeable diet shifts occurred on seasonal basis. many aquatic organisms go through ontogenetic diet shifts, which help to minimise mortality and maximise growth. thus, diet, feeding behaviour and potential for inter- and intraspeciﬁc competition likely differ through time (schleuter & eckmann 2008). such transition was apparent when the smallest yellow perch switched from a mixed diet in summer to one dominated by benthos in the fall, while large yellow perch fed almost exclusively on benthos throughout summer and fall. consideration of seasonal variation in diet studies appears very important, and results can be misleading when evaluated on a short time scale. our results of gradual transition from interspeciﬁc diet overlap during summer to prevalent intraspeciﬁc diet overlap in fall support this notion. other studies have also demonstrated seasonal patterns of diet overlap and competition between striped bass, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye (raborn et al. 2004), sauger and walleye (bellgraph et al. 2008), and yellow perch cohorts (age-0 to age-5+) (keast 1977). small yellow perch and large alewife exhibited the strongest interspeciﬁc diet overlap during summer, mainly as a result of feeding on relatively common chironomids and bosminidae. while predominantly a pelagic, open-water zooplanktivore (hewett & stewart 1989; walsh et al. 2008), alewife feeding on chiro- nomidae in nearshore environments should not be entirely surprising. strong diet overlap and stable isotope-derived similar trophic position of age-0 alewife and age-0 smallmouth bass were noted in new brunswick and indicated reliance on benthic invertebrates by both species (hanson & curry 2005). nonetheless, within the great lakes, alewife has not been viewed in the context of competition for food with native ﬁsh in the nearshore environment, which, diet overlap in nearshore lake michigan along with the scarcity of alewife diet studies in nearshore areas, has limited our understanding of their potential competitive interactions with other species in lake michigan coastal zone. our ﬁndings, however, indicate that large alewife and small yellow perch alike have quite generalised diets (both benthic and pelagic prey), suggesting that both are likely opportunistic feeders (tyson & knight 2001; pothoven & vanderploeg 2004; schleuter & eckmann 2008). this could make them less affected by competitive stressors when food is abundant and diverse. however, diet overlap and competition for food between these two species when found together in nearshore environments would escalate when prey is drastically reduced. given the current low zoo- plankton abundances, especially of cladocerans and adult copepods, alewives’ ability to switch between ﬁlter and particulate feeding based on prey availability (janssen 1976) is a clear advantage as it allows them to respond to changes in prey abundance and composi- tion. diets of large alewife also varied the most through the years, an indication they are consuming readily available prey at any given time including large exotic species such as bythotrephes (fall) and cercopagis (both seasons) and small non-natives such as dreissenid veligers. notably, these organisms were not as prevalent in the diets of native ﬁsh. interspeciﬁc competition often results in a burden on both species but can also lead to one species gaining upper hand and outcompeting the other species. in the laboratory, age-0 perch (perca ﬂuviatilis) grew slower as the density of roach (rutilus rutilus) increased (persson & greenberg 1990). just as roach can indirectly affect age-1+ perch through their effect on age-0 perch (persson & greenberg 1990), a similar mechanism may be at play for alewife and yellow perch in lake michigan. with lowered zooplankton densities, it is possible that high densities of alewife may lead small perch to switch to benthos sooner and thus face overlap and potential intraspeciﬁc competition with larger yellow perch as we saw in fall 2001 and 2002. diet breath of small alewife, large yellow perch and spottail shiners was relatively narrow and dominated by either zooplankton or invertebrates. as a result, these species ⁄ size classes could experience negative impacts of less preferred prey in times of prey shortages and ⁄ or increased competitive pressure. although the size of lake michigan does permit spatial segregation of size classes and species, we often encountered alewife, yellow perch and spottail shiner of different sizes ⁄ ages in the same area at certain times of the year (i.e., late summer and fall). during our study period, interspeciﬁc competition was likely limited because different ﬁsh species were most abundant during different years. however, extremely low abundances of zooplankton, particularly copepods 217 creque & czesny and bosminidae, which were primary zooplankton prey in common among species, along with the dominance of dreissenids in the benthic community and decline of diporeia is concerning and could lead to severe competition if high abundances of these ﬁsh species occurred simultaneously in the nearshore. continuous expansion of round goby northward and their recent establishment in the waukegan, il, could create additional competitive pressure through diet overlap for young cohorts of yellow perch. round goby <70 mm consume a variety of benthic inverte- brates, very similar to small yellow perch and other native ﬁsh (jude et al. 1995; vanderploeg et al. 2002; duncan et al. 2011). spottail shiners could also be impacted because they rely more on dreissenids and gastropods than yellow perch, and round gobies are known for highly effective ⁄ efﬁcient feeding on molluscs (ray & corkum 1997). although intraspeciﬁc competition is rarely exam- ined in great lakes diet studies, our results indicate it deserves further attention. diet overlap in fall was high for both size classes of yellow perch and alewife. competitive interactions between two successive age classes should only intensify if prey resources are low and ⁄ or if temperatures increase, rising metabolic rate and thus food demands, and could result in reduced growth rates of younger ﬁsh, thus reducing their overwinter survival (persson 1983). both plankton and benthic resources have declined since the high yellow perch abundances of the 1980s. thus, increased competition owing to declining prey levels could have contributed to the lack of back to back successful year classes of yellow perch in lake michigan since the late 1980s (redman et al. 2011). in an oligotrophic inland lake, age-0 yellow perch abundance was high when juvenile abundances were low, and no age-0 yellow perch were found when juvenile abundance was very high (sanderson et al. 1999). this pattern of annual cohort abundance ﬂuctuations indicates strong intra- speciﬁc competitive interactions that usually favour the older groups. schleuter & eckmann (2008) also showed high intraspeciﬁc diet overlap among european perch size classes (<130 mm) throughout the year in a large european lake and intraspeciﬁc diet overlap between roach and european perch was higher than inter- speciﬁc overlap in a man-made reservoir (kahl & radke 2006). these observations indicate high degree of overlap for food among conspeciﬁcs that likely also exacerbates interspeciﬁc tensions. our data provide valuable insights into feeding patterns of ﬁsh common to southwestern lake michi- gan’s nearshore in the last decade. additional informa- tion on interactions of these species is important in the light of yellow perch’s economic importance and poor recruitment since the late 1990s, alewives role as the major prey for stocked salmonids and spottail shiners as 218 an understudied forage ﬁsh. demonstrating actual competitive interactions in aquatic systems is difﬁcult, and those interactions vary both seasonally and annually as abundance of prey, predators and competitors ﬂuctuate along with other abiotic and biotic conditions (raborn et al. 2004; hanson & curry 2005; bellgraph et al. 2008). a true measure of competition and selectivity is unlikely for highly mobile species, when ﬁsh consume a wide variety of prey, and ⁄ or in a large system like lake michigan (raborn et al. 2004; hanson & curry 2005). because of these difﬁculties, we did not attempt to document actual selectivity or competition in this study. however, information on resource overlap in diets of ﬁsh and prey caught in the same areas is a critical ﬁrst step in understanding potential intra- and interspe- ciﬁc interactions in lake michigan’s nearshore regions. these data will be important to document⁄ compare future changes in lake michigan especially in the light of new species emerging as prominent members of the community (i.e., round goby). our results warrant further studies and use of other ⁄ complementary diet analysis techniques (stable isotope and fatty acid proﬁles) to better understand the dynamic coastal communities within the great lakes. acknowledgements we thank past and current technicians at the lake
