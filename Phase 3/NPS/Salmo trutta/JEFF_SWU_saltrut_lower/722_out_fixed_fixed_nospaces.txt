bioenergetics; growth; smallmouth bass; food-web effects introduction much of the research on potential impacts of climate change on stream fish populations has focused on cold-water species with narrow temperature tolerances (e.g., keleher & rahel 1996; clark et al. 2001; ri- eman et al. 2007). potential impacts on broadly dis- tributed, cool- and warm-water stream species have received less attention, although these stream species are very common and often play a vital role in shap- ing fish communities as competitors, predators or invaders bass, micropterus dolomieu (smb), is a warm-water spe- cies broadly distributed throughout central and eastern north america (across 15 states and in two canadian smallmouth cases. in some provinces) with introduced populations in many regions beyond its native range. smallmouth bass in lotic systems consume fish, crayfish and other inver- tebrates, and they occupy an important ecological position as top predators in stream food webs (e.g., rabeni 1992; johnson et al. 2008). abundance of smb in streams has been linked to habitat character- istics at multiple scales (e.g., dauwalter et al. 2007; brewer & rabeni 2011), and stream temperature has been identified as an important local habitat influence (sowa & rabeni 1995). smallmouth bass distribution in lakes is expected to shift with a warming climate (shuter & post 1990; sharma et al. 2007; sharma & jackson 2008), but little is known about how predicted changes in stream temperatures will mecha- correspondence: a. a. pease, department of natural resources management, texas tech university, mail stop 2125, lubbock, tx 79409-2125, usa. e-mail: allison.pease@ttu.edu 336 doi: 10.1111/eff.12084 nistically affect the performance of populations. rela- tionships between thermal habitat and growth of smb are well studied (e.g., beamesderfer & north 1995; king et al. 1999; dunlop & shuter 2006) and suggest that somatic growth is generally higher in warmer climates, but considerable geographical varia- tion has been observed. previous research suggests that warming temperatures might enhance smb growth and over-winter survival in northern popula- tions, allowing them to persist in areas beyond their current northern distributional limit (shuter & post 1990). warming at the southern end of the smb native range may lead to decreased growth potential as predicted for unusually warm summers in missouri ozark streams (whitledge et al. 2006). growth changes also affect predator–prey relation- ships (e.g., olson 1996) and could alter the impacts of smb on local stream food webs. strong interac- tions between smb and their prey species have been documented in stream communities. a predator–prey model revealed that in the missouri ozarks, smb and rock bass (ambloplites rupestris) consume nearly one-third of total crayfish production (rabeni 1992). non-native populations of smb have reduced the diversity of small-bodied native fish assemblages through predation (jackson 2002), and smb have the impacts of predicted climate change on growth of smb populations are important for management and conservation due to implications for species interactions, population performance and regulation of local fisheries. fish growth is highly plastic and is influenced by temperature and other habitat condi- tions such as substrate characteristics and instream cover (e.g., mcclendon & rabeni 1987; putman et al. 1995). because environmental change often impacts fish populations via effects on growth (e.g., king et al. 1999), fish growth has been used as an indicator of habitat quality. for example, munkittrick & dixon (1989) suggested that white sucker (cato- stomus commersoni) growth was an indicator of con- tamination stress in aquatic ecosystems. changes in growth rates of fishes may result in alteration of key demographic parameters such as fecundity, age to reach maturity and survival of early life stages (roff 1984; shuter & meisner 1992). life-history theory predicts individual growth will display delayed maturation and reduced reproductive investment (pianka 1970), which have been observed in fish populations (e.g., trippel 1993; shuter et al. 2005). shuter et al. (1980) found that over-winter mortality of age 0 smb was strongly size dependent and suggested that shorter growing sea- sons limit smb distribution. because smb are popular sport fish, changes in growth and population performance could have sig- nificant social and economic implications. that populations with slower in colder climates climate change and smallmouth bass growth been shown to be a greater predatory threat to native fishes than other introduced piscivores (johnson et al. 2008). reduced abundance of smb prey items has caused trophic shifts and altered food-web structure following smb introduction (vander zanden et al. 1999). changes in climate have been shown to influ- ence consumption rates in other fish species, with important impacts on population performance (e.g., biro et al. 2007; mccarthy et al. 2009). johnson et al. (2008) suggested that warming in the yampa river, colorado, might lead to increased consumptive demand for non-native smb, and higher predation rates would exacerbate negative impacts on native prey species. therefore, changes in smb consump- tion rates due to climate change may strongly affect fish assemblage structure and trophic interactions. bioenergetics modelling provides a useful method for estimating the effects of a changing thermal regime on food consumption and the energy balance which ultimately result in changes in growth (hanson et al. 1997). these models use species-specific func- tional relationships between temperature, energy den- sity of prey items and growth and can be used to predict effects of changes in temperature on growth and consumption. bioenergetics simulations are thus very useful for examining potential population-level impacts of climate change. they have been used to predict changes in somatic growth for salmonid populations (e.g., mccarthy et al. 2009; beer & anderson 2011) and changes in consumption for piscivorous fishes in the western usa (petersen & kitchell 2001; johnson et al. 2008) due to climate change. unlike correlative approaches, such as spe- cies distribution modelling, bioenergetics modelling provides a mechanistic way of examining changes in individual physiological performance in response to environmental change (mccarthy et al. 2009). the availability of extensive data on populations across north america makes smb an ideal species for examining population-level impacts of climate change. four focal populations were chosen for this study to provide a broad latitudinal gradient for comparing impacts of climate change. examining potential impacts across the native range of smb allowed us to investigate whether northern and southern populations may respond differently to changes in climate. our objectives were to (i) estimate potential changes in smb prey consumption and growth based on recently developed regional climate change models and (ii) examine how these projected changes differ across the broad latitudinal gradient of the smb native range. due to implications for species interactions, population performance and regulation of local fisheries, a better understanding of how smb populations will respond to climate change across a broad geographical range is vital for management and conservation. 337 pease & paukert materials and methods we chose four focal populations for this study: upper mississippi river, minnesota; maquoketa river, iowa; jacks fork river, missouri; and glover river, oklahoma (fig. 1). for all four populations, data were available on growth, diet and daily stream tem- peratures. descriptions of the study streams can be found in stewig (2009), paragamian & wiley (1987), rabeni (1992) and balkenbush & fisher (1999). climate projections we used downscaled regional climate projections for predicted changes in air temperature across the four study areas from three global climate models. the downscaled regional climate projections provided simulated temperatures at much finer resolutions than are yielded from global, general circulation models (gcms). the downscaling was performed by hostetler et al. (2011) using the genmom (combination of the genesis version 3.0 atmo- spheric gcm and the mom version 2.0 oceanic gcm), echam5 (from the max planck institute for meteorology, hamburg, germany) and global fluid dynamics laboratory (gfdl) gcms for pres- ent and future climates (all under the a2 ‘business as usual’ future emissions scenario) at high resolu- tion (15-km). details of the downscaling methods are described by hostetler et al. (2011), and details of the three global climate models are given in roeckner et al. (2003), delworth et al. (2006) and alder et al. (2010). projected changes in mean daily air temperature were used to predict changes in stream temperature based on relationships between air and stream temperature for each study area. we obtained data on daily stream temperatures from us geological survey stream temperature gauges nearest to each study area (on the same stream or nearest stream of the same order with a temperature gauge). correlations between current daily air temperatures (from the nearest national weather service weather station) and stream temperatures were calculated using data for 5 years based on availability of stream temperature gauge data (minnesota: 1995–1999, iowa: 2000–2004, missouri: 2006–2010, oklahoma: 2000–2004). periods of ice cover were not included in these analyses. these correlations were then applied to the projected air tem- peratures (following pilgrim et al. 1999) to estimate average daily stream temperatures for 1995, 2040 and 2060 for all three gcms. projected daily temperatures at each time step were averaged across a 5-year period (i.e., temperatures for the 2040 time step were an average of 2040–2044 temperatures). bioenergetics simulations we used a bioenergetics approach to predict potential effects of changes in stream temperature on smb prey consumption and growth for each of the four populations (hanson et al. 1997). we used the wis- consin bioenergetics model (fish bioenergetics 3.0; hanson et al. 1997), which has been widely applied to smb populations, including studies examining impacts of nesting behaviour (cooke et al. 2002), upper mississippi, mn 1 maquoketa river, ia jack’s fork river, mo 2 3 glover river, ok 4 fig. 1. map of locations of the four stream-dwelling smb study populations in the central united states. 338 other insects crayfish fish spring minnesota lowa missouri oklahoma summer/fall s n o i t r o p o r p t e d i s n o i t r o p o r p t e d i 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 minnesota lowa missouri oklahoma fig. 2. proportional composition of diets (by weight) of smb in the four study areas based on published reports (see text for cita- tions). temperatures winter duration (lyons 1997) and projected changes in reservoir and prey availability (wuellner et al. 2010) on growth. parameters for smb consumption, respiration, and egestion and excretion were obtained from shuter & post (1990) and whitledge et al. (2003). length-at-age) and seasonal to run preliminary simulations based on present- day conditions, we gathered existing data on growth, diet and stream temperatures for the four study smb populations. data on annual growth (as indexed from mean total trophic resource use came from state agency reports and published studies of the focal populations or closest (distance < 100 km) stream-dwelling smb popula- tions with data available (minnesota: waters et al. 1993; stewig 2009; iowa: paragamian 1984; paraga- mian & wiley 1987; jansen et al. 2008; missouri: covington et al. 1983; probst et al. 1984; rabeni 1992; meneau 2009; roell & distefano 2010; okla- homa: orth et al. 1983; stark & zale 1991; balken- bush & fisher 1999; dauwalter & fisher 2008). published length-at-age data were converted to weight (g) as needed for input in the bioenergetics simulations using the equation for smb developed climate change and smallmouth bass growth by kolander et al. (1993). reported length-at-age varied among the four focal smb populations along the latitudinal gradient. for example, smb in the maquoketa river, iowa, were reported to have an average length of 366 mm at age 5 (paragamian 1984; jansen et al. 2008), whereas smb in the upper mississippi, the missouri ozarks and eastern okla- homa reached average lengths of 354, 296 and 330 mm, respectively, at the same age (covington et al. 1983; orth et al. 1983; balkenbush & fisher 1999; meneau 2009; stewig 2009). diets of smb also vary among the four populations (fig. 2). in all four areas, smb consume fish, crayfish and aquatic insects, but the relative proportions of each prey cate- gory differ. for example, smb in the missouri ozarks were reported to consume a greater proportion of crayfish (rabeni 1992), and smb in the upper mississippi consumed more aquatic insects than the other three populations (unpublished data, minnesota department of natural resources). within popula- tions, smb diets are also reported to vary across sea- sons. for example, in smb populations near the glover river, oklahoma, dauwalter & fisher (2008) found that fish were more likely to be consumed by smb in spring and crayfish were a more important component of the diet in the summer. caloric density (joule per gram wet weight) of the three categories of prey items (fish, crayfish and aquatic insects) was estimated from published values for cyprinid fishes (3853 jg  1 determined for fathead minnows, whitl- edge et al. 2003), procambarus crayfish (3063 jg  1, eggleton & schramm 2002) and aquatic insect larvae (3421 jg  1, average of values for chironomidae, odonata, and ephemeroptera; cummins & wuy- check 1971). the empirical length-at-age, diet and stream tem- perature data for the four smb populations were used to run initial bioenergetics simulations representing present-day conditions. we chose to begin the simu- lation year with a 300-g smb (within the observed size range for age-4 adult smb in these populations) for a 214-day growing season (april 1–october 31), and we used the published length-at-age data and length–weight conversions to establish the weight of an average age-4 individual at the end of one growing season. using currently observed stream temperatures, growth rates and diet composition, the initial bioenergetics simulations provided an estima- tion of current consumption rates (p-value—the pro- portion of maximum consumption rate) for the four populations. to determine the effects of predicted changes in thermal habitat on prey consumption and growth, we then used the projected stream tempera- tures to run bioenergetics simulations [using p-values obtained from the initial simulations (0.7–0.8) and assuming that prey availability and energy density 339 pease & paukert remain constant] for the 1995, 2040 and 2060 time steps from climate projections from the three global climate models. results regional climate projections revealed that average air temperatures in all four study areas are expected to increase through 2060, with an average of 2–3 °c increase in the two southern areas and more modest (approximately 1 °c) warming for the northern sites. projections based on the three global climate models differed in the extent of warming predicted. in the minnesota and iowa study areas, the genmom cli- mate model indicated that air temperatures would increase slightly in 2040, but decrease slightly in 2060 ( 1.0 and  1.9 °c, respectively), whereas the eh5 and gfdl model projected increases for both future time steps in the northern sites with a net increase of approximately 2 °c for both sites by 2060. projections from all three models indicated that the missouri and oklahoma sites are expected to experience net air temperature increases of 2–4 °c. based on correlations between daily air temperatures and stream temperatures for each study area, the stream temperature projections we generated reflected these patterns (fig. 3). air and stream temperatures correlated strongly in the four study areas (mn r = 0.93, ia r = 0.92, mo r = 0.93, ok r = 0.87), and on average, an increase in 1 °c air temperature resulted in a 0.8 °c projected increase in stream tem- perature. projected net increases in stream tempera- ture based on air temperature projections through 2060 were 0.6–1.7 °c for the northern sites with increases up to 2.5 °c in summer months (gfdl) and 1.6–3.4 °c for the two southern streams with summer temperatures up to 4.2 °c warmer (gfdl). the bioenergetics model simulations based on the stream temperature projections from all three climate models indicated that smb prey consumption and growth are expected to increase (compared with pres- ent-day conditions) with the warming predicted, if proportion of maximum consumption (p-values of 0.7–0.8) remains unchanged, prey availability is not limiting and prey energy densities do not change (fig. 4; tables 1 and 2). the extent of potential increases in consumption by 2060 differed along the latitudinal gradient, with greatest increases expected in the southern populations (minnesota: 18.3%, iowa: 14.6%, missouri: 48.8%, oklahoma: 63.9%). as with the projected changes in consumption, simulations showed greater increases in growth for the southern populations. minnesota and iowa smb populations showed an increase in growth by 2060 of 4.3% and 3.2%, respectively, based on the mean of the simula- tions for the three global climate models. in the mis- 340 souri and oklahoma populations, simulations with 2060 temperature projections from the three models resulted in mean growth increases of 9.0% and 17.0%, respectively. with these projected increases in growth by 2060, annual growth of smb (starting the growing season at 300 g) would increase by 15, 11, 31 and 61 g compared with present-day rates in the minnesota, iowa, missouri and oklahoma popu- lations, respectively. for all four populations, more pronounced increases in growth rates corresponded with the relatively higher increases in temperature in summer months compared with present conditions. simulations and populations, a 1 °c across all increase in stream temperature would result in a 6.3% increase in growth and a 27.4% increase in consump- tion (fig. 5). discussion in all four study populations, stream temperatures are expected to warm through 2060, and smb growth and prey consumption are expected to increase if the increased demand for prey items can be satisfied. the extent of these changes differed along the latitu- dinal gradient, however, with greater increases in temperatures, growth and consumption predicted for the southern populations. growth of smb has been shown to be significantly influenced by temperature (e.g., dunlop & shuter 2006), and other studies have indicated that smb growth may be expected to increase with warming for lake populations in the northern parts of their range, potentially allowing for range expansion (shuter & post 1990; king et al. 1999). wuellner et al. (2010) also found that for smb in a missouri river reservoir, growth was pre- dicted to increase with projected warming tempera- tures due to climate change. our predictions of increased growth suggest that the projected moderate warming of stream temperatures in the central usa through 2060 will not exceed the limits of thermal conditions capable of supporting smb growth even for the southern study populations of this warm-water species. whitledge et al. (2006) demonstrated with bioenergetics that smb performance would be expected to decline, however, with contin- ued warming if stream temperatures more frequently exceed 27 °c. under these conditions, growth poten- tial would decrease. simulations the bioenergetics modelling technique yielded simulated impacts on smb growth and consumption across a latitudinal gradient based on population-spe- cific data on growth, feeding and temperature regime. results of the simulations, however, should be inter- preted with caution because there is uncertainty in model parameters (chipps & wahl 2008). we used the commonly applied parameters for smb consump- minnesota genmom iowa climate change and smallmouth bass growth missouri oklahoma minnesota eh5 iowa missouri oklahoma minnesota gfdl iowa missouri oklahoma 1995 2040 2060 (a) (b) ) c ° ( e r u t a r e p m e t m a e r t s  (c) 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 n a j b e f r a m r p a y a m n u j l u j g u a p e s t c o v o n c e d n a j b e f r a m r p a y a m n u j l u j g u a p e s t c o v o n c e d fig. 3. mean monthly stream temperatures at present (based on 1995 data) and for 2040 and 2060 climate change projections for the four study areas based on the genmom (a), eh5 (b) and gfdl (c) climate models. stream temperatures were modelled based on correla- tions between air temperature and stream temperature for each location (mn r = 0.93, ia r = 0.92, mo r = 0.93, ok r = 0.87). 341 minnesota iowa 1995 2040 2060 missouri oklahoma pease & paukert ) g ( t h g i e w 450 400 350 300 250 450 400 350 300 250 r p a y a m n u j l u j g u a p e s t c o r p a y a m n u j l u j g u a p e s t c o fig. 4. mean growth (g) projections for 300-g smb in the four study areas from bioenergetics simulations based on present (1995), 2040 and 2060 stream temperature projections from the genmom, gfdl and eh5 gcms. projections for future growth are based on the assumption that current feeding rates remain the same and that prey availability is not limiting. table 1. end weights (g) of 300-g smb after bioenergetics simulations (over 214-day growing season) using projected stream temperatures and present-day consumption rates for the three global climate models. simulation end weight (g) genmom eh5 gfdl population present 2040 2060 2040 2060 2040 2060 minnesota iowa missouri oklahoma 356.3 359.3 344.4 358.1 360.4 365.6 349.9 363.8 338.2 329.3 380.1 403.3 365.6 368.9 358.2 381.0 381.0 386.8 372.7 418.0 384.9 386.1 365.1 410.2 394.4 395.4 372.0 435.1 table 2. total prey consumption (g) by smb at the end of growing season (over 214 days) using projected stream bioenergetics temperatures (assuming prey availability is not limiting) for three global climate models. simulations and present-day consumption rates simulated growing season total consumption (g) genmom eh5 gfdl population present 2040 2060 2040 2060 2040 2060 minnesota iowa missouri oklahoma 733.4 757.8 958.6 788.3 810.4 836.3 1022.8 843.8 609.5 502.4 1422.8 1171.8 824.2 867.0 1164.7 981.8 956.7 1023.7 1386.5 1283.2 940.6 980.0 1280.7 1203.1 1028.4 1073.8 1418.9 1431.4 tion, respiration and egestion–excretion from shuter & post (1990) with adjustments for adult, stream- dwelling smb proposed by whitledge et al.

may exist along the latitudinal gradient of the smb range. for example, fishes often display plasticity in physiological to the sur- rounding environments (e.g., schaefer & ryan 2006) tolerances as they adapt regimes and this may occur in smallmouth bass. for some widespread fish species, however, variation in envi- ronmental tolerance is low among populations across broad latitudinal gradients (e.g., matthews 1986). future research on multiple stream smb populations examining feeding, growth and metabolism as related to temperature in the laboratory and the field may be needed to improve the accuracy of these simulations. the assumption that smb were able to feed at pres- ent-day proportions of maximum consumption also had a substantial influence on results of our simula- tions. had we simulated growth with current con- sumption rates (e.g., g per day of prey items) instead, growth may have decreased if consumption could not meet metabolic demands with warming temperatures. further, the air–stream temperature relationships used to convert air temperature projections from the gcms to daily stream temperatures ignore other nonlinear influences on stream thermal such as groundwater input, which provides thermal refugia for stream-dwelling smb (brewer & rabeni 2011) particularly in the southern sites. the role of ground- water in tempering the impacts of warming air temperatures is an important area for future research. the approach we used allowed us to predict how temperature changes would affect smb growth, but it overlooks many other factors that may influence growth directly or indirectly (e.g., changes in habitat and flow regime) which may occur with climate change. future changes in land use may be as impor- tant as changes in climate in terms of impacts on smb populations. peterson & kwak (1999) found that with altered temperatures and flows predicted under climate change scenarios, smb abundance would decline substantially in the kankakee river, illinois, land-use practices were main- tained. in simulations with historical land use and predicted alterations in temperature and flow, smb populations were predicted to increase, suggesting that land use may have an overriding influence on stream-dwelling smb in the central usa. future research is needed to investigate potential impacts of land-use change on smb populations across their native range. nonetheless, our study does elucidate some of the potential impacts that climate change may have at the population level for this common warm-water species. if current the potential changes in growth predicted here may have important implications for measures of smb population performance, such as fecundity, over-winter survival of juveniles and time to reach quality length for harvest. for example, shuter & post (1990) found that smb population viability depended upon the ability of young of year to complete a mini- mum amount of growth before winter in the northern usa and canada. changes in time to reach maturity climate change and smallmouth bass growth and desirable length associated with changes in growth have practical implication for fisheries man- agement (beamesderfer & north 1995), and managers may need to re-evaluate policies on length limits and seasonal closures in the face of climate change. changes in population performance corresponding to enhanced growth may also lead to changes in smb distribution. more favourable thermal habitat for smb may allow smb to persist beyond their current distribution following projected warming (shuter & post 1990; sharma & jackson 2008). interactions rates due to predation. through altered species the predicted increases in consumption from the bioenergetics simulations indicate that impacts of future climate on smb will have important effects on prey species. indirect effects of stream temperature change are expected to have substantial impacts on fish popula- tions (e.g., taniguchi et al. 1998; rahel & olden 2008). rabeni (1992) showed that under current con- ditions in a missouri ozark stream, there is a strong trophic linkage between smb and crayfish, with smb consumption responsible for loss of a large proportion of crayfish biomass. predation by smb thus has a strong influence on crayfish population dynamics and general energy flow. petersen and kitchell (2001) showed that with an increase in stream temperatures in the columbia river, per capita consumption of native salmonids by smb and other non-native piscivores increased, suggesting that stream warming may cause declines in first-year sal- monid survival increased smb predation with predicted northern range expan- sion due to climate change may result in the loss of over 20,000 populations of native cyprinids in ontario (jackson & mandrak 2002). in canadian lakes, non-native smb consumption altered food- web energy pathways by reducing the abundance and diversity of fish prey species, which led to a shift towards a more zooplankton-based diet in native lake_trout (vander zanden et al. 1999). predation by micropterus species indirectly impacts lower trophic levels (i.e., small invertebrates, algae) negatively or positively (reviewed in jackson 2002), and thus, stream ecosystems may experience cascading effects of changes in smb consumption. with projected increases in growth rates, smb may also experience earlier ontogenetic shifts from smaller invertebrate prey to crayfish and fish prey (mittelbach & persson 1998; dauwalter & fisher 2008), which would change the seasonality of trophic interactions and shorten the amount of time that some prey taxa are invulnerable due to smb gape size constraints (olson 1996). in addition to altered predator–prey interac- tions, climate change may also potentially impact competitive interactions between smb and other spe- cies. largemouth bass (micropterus salmoides), for 343 pease & paukert example, are expected to benefit from warming stream temperatures and may increasingly compete with smb for resources (zweifel et al. 1999). in sum, impacts of projected climate change on smb populations may have important implications for other species in north american streams, and climate responses of other species may also affect smb populations. most of the prior research on potential impacts of climate change on stream fish populations has focused on salmonids and other species expected to be sensitive to warming temperatures. however, very few studies have examined impacts on species more tolerant to warming, or on populations in streams in the central usa. the distribution of some warm- water fish species is expected to increase with antici- pated climate change scenarios (eaton & scheller 1996; lyons et al. 2010), but studies examining pop- ulation-level impacts on these species are scarce. we found that across a latitudinal gradient in the usa, stream populations of smb are predicted to experi- ence increased growth and consumption rates with projected temperature increases. these projections provide support for previous predictions that smb will be a ‘winner’ species in climate change scenarios (shuter & post 1990; sharma et al. 2007), and we provide population-specific information on impacts based on regionally downscaled climate models. the projected increase in growth rates relies on a key assumption that prey resource availability will not be limiting, and prior research shows that if warming continues beyond the extent projected through 2060, smb growth may be inhibited (whitledge et al. 2006). our results show that predicted changes in stream temperature may affect the population perfor- mance of an economically important species, and that these changes may have substantial implications for species interactions and food-web dynamics. a better understanding of how smb populations will respond to climate change across their broad native range is vital for management and conservation. acknowledgements results funding for this research was provided by the us geological survey, national climate change and wildlife science cen- ter. the authors thank steve hostetler and
