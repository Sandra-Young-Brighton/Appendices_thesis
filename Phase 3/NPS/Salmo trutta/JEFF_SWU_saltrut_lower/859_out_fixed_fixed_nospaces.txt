holtgrieve & schindler, 2011; rex & petticrew, 2008; scheuerell, levin, zabel, williams, & sanderson, 2005; vanni, 2002; wipfli, hudson, & caouette, 1998), but is less explored for other anadromous fish. pacific salmon are large- bodied nutrient vectors that contribute 3.0% of their body mass as nitrogen (n) and 0.36% of their body mass as phosphorus (p) in the form of excretions, gametes and carcasses to freshwater areas where they spawn (brock, leavitt, schindler, & quay, 2007). these nutrients can benefit progeny by increasing the productivity of rearing grounds but can also influence the productivity of entire ecosystems at multiple trophic levels. the decline of once great salmon runs in the columbia river basin (crb) has reduced salmon- derived nutrient inputs to spawning grounds. columbia river basin salmon once num- bered from 11 to 16 million per year and imported millions of kg of n and hundreds of thousands of kg of p annually (gresh, lichatowich, & schoonmaker, 2000). these nutrient inputs have decreased by 90% with an associated decline in the productivity of salmon spawning grounds. this loss in productivity could inhibit ongoing salmon resto- ration efforts. in response, salmon restoration programmes annually supplement spawning grounds with carcasses and carcass analogues 310  |  wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/eff ecol freshw fish. 2018;27:310–322. published 2017. this article is a u.s. governmentwork and is in the public domain in the usahaskell     |  311 in the pacific northwest to stimulate primary and invertebrate pro- ductivity in salmon streams (kohler, rugenski, & taki, 2008; kohler et al., 2012, 2013). yet the success of these mitigation measures and the pathways in which these nutrients move through food webs is not fully understood (collins, marcarelli, baxter, & wipfli, 2015; ebel, marcarelli, & kohler, 2014). although salmon have received much at- tention, other anadromous fish, including nonnatives, could also play significant roles in nutrient transport. while salmon numbers in the crb have declined, nonnative american shad (alosa sapidissima) have naturalised and become abun- dant since their introduction to the west coast in 1871 (green, 1874). in the columbia river, american shad were first collected in the late 1800s and increased slightly in the early to mid- 1900s. however, shad numbers increased sharply after closure of the dalles dam (river ki- lometre (rkm) 308) and subsequent inundation of celilo falls, a pre- viously impassable barrier, in 1957. numbers jumped again after fish ladder modifications alleviated congestion of upstream migrating salmon and shad at lower columbia river dams in the early 1970s (hinrichsen, hasselman, ebbesmeyer, & shields, 2013; monk, weaver, thompson, & ossiander, 1989). the number of shad migrating up- stream past each successive dam decreases with distance from the pacific ocean with only a few fish migrating past lower granite dam on the snake river and priest rapids dam (rkm 639) on the columbia river (figure 1). shad are generally restricted to impounded mainstem reaches of the lower crb; however, annual totals usually exceed those of all salmon stocks combined (figure 2). life- history diversity is a fundamental component of anadromy with implications for nutrient transport. salmon spawn in a wide variety of locations within river basins such as the columbia. for example, steelhead (o. mykiss) and spring chinook (stream type; o. tshawytscha) primarily spawn in headwater streams, while fall chinook (ocean type) spawn in mainstem habitats. sockeye (o. nerka) spawning is generally associated with headwater lakes, while chum (o. keta) spawn relatively close to saltwater (groot & margolis, 1991). juveniles can also exhibit significant life- history variation. juvenile spring chinook spend an entire year in natal streams and then quickly migrate on the ascending limb of the hydrograph, while fall chinook juveniles migrate as subyearlings as flows decease in summer. spring chinook juveniles rear in habitats farther from the ocean, have lower growth opportunity (liss et al., 2006) and pre- sumably benefit more from nutrient inputs. subsequently, nutri- ent enhancement programmes have largely focused on headwater streams and lakes—most likely to benefit sockeye, steelhead and spring chinook salmon. washington n a e c o c i f i c a p columbia river wanapum dam bonneville dam john day dam mcnary dam the dalles dam priest rapids dam ice harbor dam lower granite dam snake river figure 1 range of nonnative american shad upstream to wanapum dam on the columbia river and lower granite dam on the snake river. the cut- out is the study area, john day reservoir oregon john day reservoir 312  |     ) s n o i l l i m ( s n u t e r t l u d a 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 american shad salmon and steelhead 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 year figure 2 annual return of american shad (bold line) and all salmon and steelhead combined (thin line) to bonneville dam, columbia river, 1938 to 2015 (fish passage center 2016) despite their great abundance in the crb, there is considerable uncertainty about american shad life history. unlike most salmon, shad exhibit varying degrees of iteroparity. in their native range on the atlantic coast, shad exhibit latitudinal variation in their degree of iteroparity where southern populations are semelparous and northern populations exhibit as much as 73% iteroparity (leggett & carscadden, 1978). in the columbia river, petersen, hinrichsen, gadomski, feil, and rondorf (2003) estimated that 32% of american shad are repeat spawners. adult shad passage peaks at john day dam (rkm 347) in june followed quickly by spawning. shad spawn within the water col- umn, in water <5 m deep, and fertilised eggs are carried downstream by the current (stier & crance, 1985). eggs develop rapidly and shad larvae emerge within weeks, recruit to shorelines and begin feeding within a few months after spawning (petersen et al., 2003). in john day reservoir, larval density peaks in july (gadomski & barfoot, 1998) and juvenile density peaks in september with most emigrating by november (haskell, tiffan, & rondorf, 2006). like juvenile salmon, shad can exhibit life- history diversity. parsley, sauter, and wetzel (2011) identified a juvenile variant in the lower crb that rears in freshwater for 1–2 years before emigrating seaward. water velocity (31–91 cm/s), temperature (14–21°c) and substrate (sand and gravel) preferences in their native range (walburg & nichols, 1967) suggest that shad spawn in the upper reaches of mainstem columbia river reservoirs. rapid de- velopment rates of young also suggest that shad spawn close to or within mainstem reservoirs. however, little work has been carried out to identify the specific spawning areas of american shad in the crb. although relatively unstudied on the pacific coast of north america, american shad and other alosines (blueback herring (a. aes- tivalis) and alewife (a. pseudoharengus)) convey large quantities of marine- derived nutrients in their native range along the atlantic coast (durbin, nixon, & oviatt, 1979; post & walters, 2009; walters, barnes, & post, 2009; west, walters, gephard, & post, 2010). spawning ale- wives delivered 0.43 g p m−2 and 2.7 g n m−2 over a 2- month period to a freshwater pond in rhode island—a level similar to that of pacific haskell salmon (durbin et al., 1979). limburg, hattala, and kahnle (2003) es- timated that historical american shad runs of 1 million fish could have imported 18,000 kg n to rivers of the south- eastern united states. american shad may have a similar potential to deliver marine- derived nutrients to freshwater where they spawn and influence the produc- tivity of lower columbia river reservoirs. as restoration of anadromous fish stocks continues on both coasts, there has been an increased effort to quantify nutrient fluxes attribut- able to anadromous fish. large numbers of nonnative american shad could increase the productivity of lower columbia river reservoirs. although there is no routine monitoring of biological attributes, chlo- rophyll- a concentrations in john day reservoir indicate a trophic class ranging from oligo- to mesotrophic (gilbreath, smith, ledgerwood, pool, & grabowski, 2000). the productivity of lower columbia river reservoirs is important in part because juvenile salmon also use them for rearing and growth (haskell, tiffan, & rondorf, 2013; rondorf, gray, & fairley, 1990). more n than p is probably conveyed upstream by american shad and likely takes varying forms (no− 4). 2 and nh+ although p (po4) is generally considered to be the most limiting nutrient to phytoplankton in freshwater (blomqvist, gunnars, & elmgren, 2004; schindler, 1977), the general paradigm of p limitation in freshwater has come under increased scrutiny (elser et al., 2007; paerl et al., 2016). pacific northwest watersheds are generally characterised by relatively high nutrient enrichment with the forested region of the west side of the cascade mountains contributing more n and geologic material and the eastside of the cascade mountains generating more p (wise & johnson, 2011). in the upper columbia basin, kootenay lake, british columbia is reported to be p- limited despite substantial anthropogenic p inputs (northcote, pick, fillion, & salter, 2005), whereas flathead lake, montana, is co- limited by n and p (spencer & ellis, 1998). therefore, there is a need to estimate not only the flux of nutrients from anadromous fishes but their influence on nutrient limitation. 3, no− the interaction between nutrient flux, limitation and spatial ex- tent has often been overlooked in studies of anadromous fish nutri- ent loading. the magnitude of nutrient import by adults has received considerable attention (gresh et al., 2000; larkin & slaney, 1997; twining, palkovacs, friedman, hasselman, & post, 2016). nutrient flux has also been described to account not only for import by adults but also export by juveniles (moore & schindler, 2004; moore et al., 2011) and postspawn adults (iteroparity; childress, allan, & mcintyre, 2014; durbin et al., 1979; west et al., 2010). however, only recently have studies investigated the relation between fluxes and existing biologi- cal productivity (holtgrieve & schindler, 2011; levi et al., 2013; west et al., 2010). for american shad, spatial context and biological pro- ductivity are particularly important because these fish spawn within the water column and are not associated with a specific land area, in contrast to salmon and “spawning grounds.” given their potential to convey large quantities of nutrients to res- ervoirs of the lower crb, i quantified the nutrient flux attributable to nonnative american shad and inferred how nutrient loading may have shifted spatially and temporally from what was historically contributed by salmon. my specific objectives were to (i) quantify n and p flux resulting from nonnative american shad and determine whether shad haskell are a net source or sink of nutrients to john day reservoir, (ii) sum- marise seasonal and historical trends of n and p in john day reservoir and relate them to the annual flux of nutrients from shad and (iii) com- pare nutrient loads conveyed by american shad to current and histori- cal estimates of nutrients conveyed by salmon in the crb. 2 |  methods 2.1 | study area i conducted my study in john day reservoir, a system separated from the columbia river estuary by three intervening dams and two reser- voirs. the reservoir is impounded by john day dam, the largest main- stem impoundment on the lower columbia river. it has a surface area of 222.6 km2, a mean depth of 14 m and a maximum depth of 55 m. john day reservoir is generally considered a “run- of- the- river” reservoir with a storage capacity of 3.12 × 109 m3 and a mean water retention time of only 9 days (2008–2015 range: 7.1–10.3 days). water tempera- tures range from 2 to 22°c annually, but the reservoir does not thermally stratify due to the short retention times and seasonally high winds that mix the water column during summer. the reservoir is generally oligo- to mesotrophic with zooplankton abundance heavily influenced by physical controls such as reservoir retention time and water temperature (haskell et al., 2006). still, zooplankton abundance and production is high relative to other reservoirs in the lower snake and columbia rivers (emerson, bollens, & counihan, 2015; haskell et al., 2006, 2013). based on adult passage from dam counts, john day reservoir is the final destination of many adult american shad in the crb, presumably to spawn. i chose john day reservoir as my study site for several reasons. first, john day reservoir has a long- term nutrient monitoring site at the top end of the reservoir operated by the washington department of ecology. second, adult shad are counted at the upstream end of john day reservoir at mcnary dam (rkm 470) and at the downstream end of the reservoir at john day dam. third, smolt monitoring facilities (smf) at mcnary dam and john day dams have bypass collection counts of emigrating juvenile american shad that could be used to estimate the daily passage of juvenile shad at both dams. lastly, although food web research in the crb is scarce, john day reservoir has some peer- reviewed food web literature from which inferences could be drawn. 2.2 | measuring nutrient concentrations although the models developed here were developed for john day reservoir, i collected shad for nutrient determination from bonneville dam (rkm 235) due to the infrastructure already in place to collect (as opposed to merely count) upstream and downstream migrating fish. prespawning adult shad migrating upstream were collected at the bonneville dam adult fish facility and juvenile and postspawn shad migrating downstream were collected at the smf. upon collection, fish were euthanised, placed on ice and transported to the u.s. geological survey, columbia river research laboratory in cook, wa, for processing. fish were homogenised using a 4.26- l (4.50 qt) robot coupe blixer food processor. multiple juvenile shad were     |  313 combined prior to homogenising to achieve a final dry weight of at least 5 g. pre- and postspawning adults were individually homogenised. the food processor was rinsed after processing each fish. samples of ho- mogenised fish were placed in a drying oven for 24 hr and then further ground using a mortar and pestle and a faberware single serve grinder to achieve a final dry weight of at least 5 g. samples were then placed back in the drying oven for up to 72 hr until a constant dry weight was achieved. dried samples were sent to the university of idaho, analytical sciences laboratory, for determination of total n and p. total n was determined via combustion using a leco cns- 2000. total p was de- termined using an optima 3200 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. the detection limit for total n was 0.002% and for total p was 4 μg/g. i also dried individual juveniles and samples of adult pre- and postspawn fish to estimate moisture content. these fish were dried for up to 72 hr to a constant weight. fish moisture content values were then used to estimate the wet weight concentration of nu- trients from dry weight concentrations. to examine seasonal and annual trends in n and p in john day reservoir, i obtained n and p data from a washington department of ecology water quality monitoring station where nutrient concen- trations are recorded monthly (wdoe, 2015). the monitoring station (station # 31a070) is located in john day reservoir 1.5 km downstream of mcnary dam near umatilla, oregon. to assess nutrient limitation in john day reservoir, i used the ratio of combined nh3- n (ammonia), no2- n (nitrite) and no3- n (nitrate) (hereafter total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (din)) to soluble reactive phosphorus (hereafter dissolved in- organic phosphorus (dip)), to gain a general understanding of limiting nutrients in john day reservoir. concentrations (mg/l) of din and dip were converted to molar equivalents (μm/l) to examine seasonal and historical trends in n:p ratios and the relative importance of n and p conveyed by shad. to compare my estimates of nutrient loading by american shad to background loads, i estimated mean daily total phosphorus (tp) loads in john day reservoir from 2008 to 2015 from tp concentrations col- lected monthly 1.5 km below mcnary dam and mean daily discharge values from mcnary dam. i calculated a mean daily load (kg/day) for every day of the year but because tp data were only collected once per month, i used tp concentrations for every day of the month in which they were collected. the final estimate of mean daily tp loading was the mean of the daily tp loads for each year from 2008 to 2015. 2.3 | quantifying nutrient flux i applied fish nutrient concentrations from fish collected at bonneville dam to population numbers estimated for john day dam and then calculated nutrient fluxes attributable to annual shad runs. the amount of n and p imported by adult american shad was estimated using a model similar to moore et al. (2011), where: it = atxmmnm,pm + atymfnf,pf here, it is the annual amount imported by adults (kg), at is the number of adults passing john day dam minus the number of adults 314  |     passing mcnary dam, x is the proportion of males and y is the pro- portion of females in the adult population, mm is the average mass of a male (kg), mf is the average mass of a female, nm,pm is the concen- tration of n or p in a male (%) and nf,pf is the concentration of n or p in a female (%). i calculated shad- derived nutrients annually using fish weight data collected in 2007 and 2015. in 2007, male and female prespawners were 12.4% and 6.5% smaller respectively, while male and female postspawners were 39.8% and 22.7% smaller respectively (table 1). therefore, i performed separate model runs across the years using fish weights from 2007 (hereafter small fish) and fish weights from 2015 (hereafter large fish). counting of adult shad at john day dam ceased in 2003; therefore, i developed a relationship between the number of adults counted at bonneville dam and john day dam from 1968 to 2003 and predicted adult numbers at john day from 2004 to 2015 based on the bonneville dam adult counts (figure 3; y = 0.6193x, df = 35, r2 = 0.87). i applied fish nutrient concentrations of emigrating fish collected at bonneville dam to population numbers estimated for john day dam and then calculated nutrient export attributable to annual shad runs where the export of nutrients (et) was estimated as the sum of nu- trients exported by out- migrating juveniles (kg), postspawning males (kg) and postspawning females (kg): et = jtmjnj,pj + atxmmnmp,pmpkmbm + atymfnfp,pfpkfbf where jt = the number of out- migrating juveniles in a given year, mj = the average wet mass of a juvenile and nj,pj = the concentration of n or p in a juvenile (%). in the second half of the equation, km and kf are the probabilities of males and females surviving spawning and emigrating from john day reservoir respectively (0.32; petersen et al., 2003), bm and bf are the proportional change in mass (kg) of males and females during spawning, nmp,pmp = the concentration of n and p in a postspawn male (%) and nfp,pfp = the concentration of n and p in a postspawn female (%). shad were considered net importers of nutrients based on the relationship between gross import it and export et. to estimate jt, as the sum of ni from i = 0−t, i calculated the daily pas- sage abundance of juvenile shad at john day and mcnary dams as the number counted at the respective juvenile bypass facility over a given time interval divided by the sampling rate over that interval, where: ni = yi∕ci, haskell here ni = the total number of juveniles passing on day i, yi = the number of fish estimated to pass the dam via the bypass system (number counted/sample rate) and ci = the collection probability. to estimate ci, i used logistic regression equations developed by mccann et al. (2015) for spring/summer chinook salmon juveniles passing mcnary and john day dams. for both dams, the logit- transformed col- lection probability was calculated as follows: logit(p) =β0 + β1 ∗ discharge + β2 ∗ prop spill + β3 ∗ weir + β4 ∗ flow ∗ prop spill for john day dam, β0 = −0.9628, β1 = 0.0062, β2 = −7.1784, β3 = −0.4641 and β4 = 0. for mcnary dam, β0 = 0.8503, β1 = 0.0028, β2 = −2.8578, β3 = −0.4641 and β4 = −0.0092. discharge is equal to the average discharge in thousands of cubic feet per second occur- ring over the day and prop spill is equal to the average proportion of water passing through the spillways for a given day. weir is ei- ther 1 or 0 depending on the presence of a spillway weir. there is no spillway weir at mcnary dam, but a spillway weir has been in place since 2008 at john day dam. bypass probability (yi) was then estimated as: yi = exp (logit(p)) 1 + exp (logit(p)) and total powerhouse passage probability (phi) was estimated as: phi = yi∕fge where the fish guidance efficiency (fge) for spring/summer juvenile chinook salmon at john day dam is 0.65 and at mcnary dam is 0.81 (mccann et al., 2015). the total number of juveniles passing each dam annually was estimated as: jt =ࢣ (phi∕ni) over the 20 years that i estimated juvenile daily passage abun- dance, the bypass facilities did not sample fish every day and gen- erally ended annual sampling in mid- to late september. therefore, i used linear interpolation to fill in days that were not sampled. i as- sumed that juvenile shad outmigration past john day dam ended on december 1st of every year, as suggested by trawling data from john day reservoir (haskell et al., 2013). finally, the number of juveniles table 1 american shad postspawner estimates of nutrient export parameter mean

derived n and p to john day reservoir and were net importers of both nutri- ents in nearly all the years that i examined (figure 4). when large fish weights were used (2015), shad were net importers of n and p in all years; however, when small fish weights were used, shad were net exporters of n (577 kg) and p (1,342 kg) in 2000 and net exporters of p (195 kg) but not n in 2015. during the 2 years that shad were net exporters of nutrients (n and p in 2000, p only in 2015), they exhibited small- to- moderate adult returns but large numbers of emigrating juve- niles. on average, juveniles and postspawners exported 31% of the n (range: 22.9–68.6%) and 46% of the p (range: 33.6–97.6%) imported by adults. across all years, exported p was consistently a larger frac- tion of imported p than exported n was of imported n. the % p wet weight of postspawners (male: 0.96%, female: 1.00%) and juveniles (0.89%) was greater than upstream migrant adults (male: 0.67%, fe- male: 0.67%). the % n of postspawners (male: 2.79%, female: 3.22%), juveniles (2.80%) and prespawners (male: 2.94%, female: 2.96%) was similar (table 2). the weight of the fish that i sampled varied between sexes and years. both male and female adult postspawn fish were significantly larger in 2015 compared to 2007. prespawn females and males were both larger in 2015 than in 2007, although these differences were not significant (table 1). prespawn females were significantly larger than prespawn males in 2007 and postspawn females were signifi- cantly larger than postspawn males in 2007 but not in 2015. while adults were larger in 2015, juveniles were significantly larger in 2007 (table 2). the greater size of 2015 fish relative to 2007 fish was gen- erally associated with greater annual p and n flux

spawners in john day reservoir has increased since counts began at john day dam in 1968 (figure 5). however, the estimated number of spawners in 2015 (0.12 million) was the lowest since 1977 (0.04 million). over the years that i mod- elled (1994–2015), adult spawner numbers ranged from 0.12 mil- lion in 2015 to 1.66 million in 2003, with a mean of 0.73 million. spawner number was generally higher from 2002 to 2007. during 1993, fewer shad were counted at john day dam (0.64 million) than at mcnary dam (0.70 million). shad imported an average (± sd) of 20,263 (± 11,610 kg n) and 4,603 (± 2,637 kg p) to john day reservoir annually when calculated using 2015 fish weights. using 2007 fish weights, shad imported an average of 18,358 316  |     haskell table 2 mean weight of 2015 (number)

export the estimated number of juveniles spawned in john day dam ranged from 0 to over 112 million from 1997 to 2015, with an an- nual mean (sd) of 22.2 million (± 26.1 million). i estimate that juve- niles exported an average of 1,260 (± 1,486 kg n) and 400 (± 472 kg p) annually. when small juveniles were modelled, they exported an average of 2,199 (± 2,593 kg n) and 696 (± 821 kg p). during 1997, 2001 and 2013, i estimated more juveniles emigrating past mcnary dam than past john day dam. for these years, the only nutrients exported from john day reservoir were from adults that survived spawning. adult postspawners transported a larger fraction of the overall nutrient export than juvenile shad during most years (figure 6). the number of adults that survived spawning (calculated as a constant fraction of males and females) ranged from 39,777 in 2015 to 529,627 in 2003 (mean = 232,638; sd = 128,987). on average, postspawners exported 4,631 (± 2,567 kg n) and 1,546 (± 857 kg p) using large fish. using small fish, postspawners exported an average of 3,031 (± 1,180 kg n) and 1,006 kg (± 558 kg p). (± 10,177 kg n) and 4,172 (± 2,313 kg p). on average, adult shad imported 23.8 g n and 5.4 g p per male compared to 33.3 g of n and 7.6 g p per female. 3.3 | nutrient loading and limitation mean daily tp loading into john day reservoir exhibited a similar seasonal trend as mcnary dam discharge (figure 7), but there was adult p import post spawner p export juvenile p export haskell 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 ) g k f o s 0 0 0 , 1 ( x u l f p 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 year figure 6 annual trends in net annual n flux (top panel) and net annual p flux (bottom panel) to john day reservoir from american shad, 1997–2015. solid lines and closed circles are 2007 fish weights, dashed lines 2015 fish weights in john day reservoir, columbia river. bold line is the dividing line between years that result in an overall net import and net export of a particular nutrient to john day reservoir no relation between discharge and total or dissolved phosphorus concentration within the reservoir. tp loading ranged from 3,157 to 18,916 kg/day during 2008–2015, with seasonal peaks from may to july and seasonal minima during september. discharge from mcnary dam followed a similar seasonal pattern, although slightly delayed, with peaks in june. mean daily discharge from 2008 to 2015 ranged from 2,369 to 9,385 m3/s (overall mean = 4,899 m3/s). my phosphorus data indicated similar seasonal trends but overall decreases in the amount of p loaded into john day reservoir since 1990. from 1990 to 1999, mean monthly dissolved orthophosphate at mcnary dam was 12.6 μg/l, while from 2000 to 2006, it was 9.4 μg/l, and from 2007 to 2015, it was 8.3 μg/l. similarly, in priest rapids reservoir (where shad are nearly absent), mean monthly total     |  317 p from 1976 to 1982 ranged from 10 to 75 μg/l, but was about 10 to 15 μg/l lower when measured from 1988 to 1992 and 1994 to 1997 (normandeau, 2000). decreases in p loading into john day reservoir coincided with general increases in the number of shad spawners. total p loads in john day reservoir were similar to those reported farther downstream. mean daily tp loads for water year 2001 were 6,713 kg/day at warrendale, oregon (rkm 224), 9,934 kg/day just up- stream of the willamette and columbia river confluence (rkm 164), and 26,800 kg/day at the beaver army terminal (rkm 87; wise et al., 2007). annual tp loads (kg/year) from my data ranged from 2.3 to 4.7 million kg/year. these estimates were similar to annual tp loads ranging from 2.5 to 4.4 million kg p/year at rkm 87 as reported by wise et al. (2007). n:p ratios varied seasonally in john day reservoir with peaks in march and april but with little change from june thru january (figure 8). when compared to 2000–2006 and 2007–2015, n:p ra- tios from 1990 to 1999 exhibited similar seasonal trends but were lower for most of the year. in 1990–1999, mean n:p ratios ranged from a low of 17.6 in july perhaps indicating n and p co- limitation to a peak of 56.1 in march suggesting p limitation. the peak seasonal n:p ratio in 2000–2006 was 81.5 in april, and from 2007 to 2015, it was 127.8 during march. overall, n:p ratios generally exceeded 30 from january through may, with peaks in march and april, but then remained around 30 from june through december. seasonal n:p ratio patterns were similar from year to year, but did not coincide with sea- sonal discharge patterns, which typically peaked in may and june at mcnary dam (figure 7). my data indicated historical changes in n:p ratios. in recent years (2007- present), n:p ratios increased with slightly increasing n levels but decreasing p levels (figure 8). seasonal patterns of n:p ratios in- dicated the highest values from february to april and the lowest val- ues in july, with mean monthly values ranging from 16.3 to 53.6 and individual monthly ratios ranging from 10.7 to 100.3. ratios exhibited similar seasonal trends with peaks in march or april and lows during october or november. mean n:p ratios ranged from 17.6 to 56.1 phosphorus discharge 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 i g n d a o l p ) y a d g k f / o s 0 0 0 , 1 ( figure 7 seasonal trend in mean daily discharge (thin line) and median daily p loading (bold line) in john day reservoir, columbia river, 2008 to 2015 2 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec month 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 , ( 1 0 0 0 s o f m 3 / s ) i d s c h a r g e 318  |     o i t a r : p n 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1990–1999 2000–2006 2007–2015 jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec month figure 8 seasonal trend in the ratio of mean monthly n:p ratios collected in the upper john day reservoir, columbia river (rkm 468), from 1990 to 1999 (solid line), 2000 to 2006 (dashed line) and 2007 to 2015 (dotted line). the shaded area represents the area of co- limitation of din:dip as described by ptacnik et al. (2010) during 1990–1999, from 23.1 to 81.5 during 2000–2006 and from 27.2 to 127.8 from 2007–2015. the amount of marine- derived n and p imported by american shad was a small percentage of background loading into john day reservoir. american shad contributed <0.2% of the total annual p load into john day reservoir. during june when most adult shad were mi- grating into john day reservoir to spawn, they contributed as much as 2.0% of the monthly p load. similarly, adult shad only contributed 0.06% of the overall n load to john day reservoir, and during june, they contributed <1% of the n load to john day reservoir. 4 |  discussion the decline of salmon runs in the columbia river basin has created a nutrient deficit (gresh et al., 2000), but this deficit is probably re- stricted to headwater spawning areas and not the mainstem where shad presumably spawn. while large numbers of nonnative shad have the potential to offset nutrient deficits, shad spawn in the lower crb and the estuary (hinrichsen et al., 2013), while salmon historically spawned throughout the crb. today, most crb salmon return to haskell hatcheries; however, the majority of these carcasses are returned to the watershed for nutrient enhancement (twining et al., 2016). shad import similar amounts of n and p as salmon during most years, but far less than what salmon imported historically (table 3). shad import as much as 46,120 kg n and 10,426 kg p to john day reservoir, but as much as 149,000 kg n and 34,000 kg p annually above bonneville dam. if indeed the major shad spawning areas are downstream of bonneville dam—an area where no counts of adults are available (hammann, 1981; pearcy & fisher, 2011), the overall nutrient import by shad is probably much greater. others speculate that as many as 50% of the american shad entering the columbia river do not pass bonneville dam because of low upstream passage efficiencies at columbia basin dams (hard & kynard, 1997; haro & castro- santos, 2012; monk et al., 1989). the total number of hatchery smolts is similar to estimates of juvenile american shad out- migrants presented here, and i estimate that juvenile shad can export as much as 2,000 kg of p from john day reservoir when juvenile shad numbers are high (e.g., 112 million in 2000). despite spawner numbers being <10% of what they were historically, the total number of smolts migrating through the lower columbia river is far greater today, with potential implications for nu- trient balances. the decline of salmon in the crb has led to a nutrient deficit that could be exacerbated by as many as 150 million hatchery smolts released annually. however, hatchery releases of salmon usu- ally result in a net input of n and p owing to out of river production and high mortality (e.g., 40%) soon after they are released (warren & mcclure, 2012). hatchery rearing and production account for most of the nutrient content of smolts (but see naiman et al., 2012), whereas juvenile shad are derived from in- river production. thus, juvenile shad have a greater potential to positively influence the net export of nutri- ents than do juvenile salmon in the modern columbia river. although the juvenile shad i collected were all young of the year, juvenile shad can exhibit extended freshwater rearing (parsley et al., 2011) which could decrease nutrient export by american shad. my data show that american shad import substantial nutri- ents relative to other anadromous fish runs, but have little effect on underlying nutrient balances in the lower columbia river. when shad are spawning (mid- may to mid- july), i estimate that, on average, 828,412 kg of p is loaded into john day reservoir via discharge from mcnary dam. during 2003, i estimated that american shad loaded 10,477 kg of p, amounting to just a 1.3% increase in p loading over table 3 the number, biomass, n import and p import of historical high and low salmon numbers, current high and low salmon numbers and current high and low american shad. current highs and lows are between 1997 and 2015. historical estimates were for the entire crb, while current salmon and shad estimates are for the portion above bonneville dam. all numbers are in thousands parameter number biomass (kg) n import (kg) p import (kg) historical salmon (low) 10,000a 75,808a 2,302a 272a historical salmon (high) 16,000a 101,632a 3,087a 365a ahistorical salmon estimates collected from gresh et al.

(1979) suggested that alewife contribute more n and p per unit area than pacific salmon, which infers higher spawning densities especially given their smaller body size. salmon spawning densities can exceed 10/m2 (schindler et al., 2003). aggregations (2.3/ m2) of nonnative armoured catfish (pterygoplichthys spp.) significantly increase dissolved n and p concentrations via excretion (capps & flecker, 2013). although spawning densities of shad in the crb are unknown, hinrichsen et al. (2013) estimated that only 10% of john day reservoir had silt- free gravel that was suitable for spawning and that cross sectional water velocity gradients could further restrict the spawning distribution of american shad. while shad are unlikely to have broad influence on biological productivity, they may have more pronounced localised effects on nutrient concentrations. direct counts of upstream migrating adults allowed for relatively accurate estimates of shad spawners in john day reservoir, but similar counts of juvenile shad were not available. therefore, i used logistic re- gression equations developed for estimating the collection probability of spring/summer juvenile chinook salmon at mcnary and john day smfs to estimate numbers of juvenile shad. but differences in size and behaviour could affect juvenile shad probability of collection. previous estimates of juvenile shad density in john day reservoir using hydro- acoustics ranged from 415 to 15,030/ha (haskell et al., 2013). given an overall reservoir surface area of 22,260 ha, these densities equate to total numbers ranging from 9 to 334 million juvenile shad on spe- cific dates from august thru november. my total population estimates of juvenile shad originating in john day reservoir (0–112 million) fall within this range. reductions in juvenile shad emigrating from john day reservoir during some years could also result from predation by smallmouth bass (micropterus dolomieu), walleye (sander vitreus; rose et al., 2012) and later migrating juvenile chinook salmon (haskell, beauchamp, & bollens, 2017). although our estimates of emigrating juvenile shad are probably not as accurate as similar estimates for ju- venile salmon, they are reasonable for estimating nutrient flux. while adult salmon are counted as they pass all columbia river dams, adult shad are only counted at bonneville, mcnary, priest rapids and wanapum dams and at ice harbor and lower granite dams on the snake river (figure 1). during 1993 when shad were still     |  319 counted at john day dam, fewer were counted there then at the next upstream dam, mcnary. a similar occurrence of higher adult counts at an upstream dam occasionally occurs at the dalles dam (fish passage center, 2016) possibly due to shad passing dams via the navigation locks where they are not counted. our estimates of adult shad at mcnary and john day dams could have been slightly different than reported here, although these differences were probably small. i ap- plied nutrient concentrations from fish collected at bonneville dam and applied them to john day reservoir—112 km upstream. overall nutrient inputs to john day reservoir from adult shad excretions and possible spawning below john day dam could be slightly lower than what i report. while i examined the relationship between shad and dissolved inorganic nutrients in the river, i made no attempt to quantify the subsidy that shad carcasses provide to piscivores and invertebrate scavengers. my work suggests that shad probably have little effect on autotrophic pathways associated with nutrient uptake by primary producers. however, nutrients conveyed by shad could influence food webs through direct consumption of eggs, fry and carcasses (cederholm, kunze, murota, & sibatani, 1999). in the rappahannock river, virginia, piscivores displayed a marine signal from alosa spp. spawning runs, leading to the conclusion that unlike pacific salmon, which import nutrients to the base of the food web, shad are more likely to influence the top of the food web as prey (flecker et al., 2010; macavoy, garmin, & macko, 2008). decomposing trout carcasses in the rio gambarello, italy, contained chironomids at densities of 110/ carcass (fenoglio, bo, cammarata, malacarne, & del frate, 2010). decomposing shad could also provide food for chironomids, an im- portant prey item of juvenile salmon. shad carcasses could also be an important food source for white sturgeon (acipenser transmontanus), crayfish (astacus spp.), and a host of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa, yet have little effect on underlying nutrient balances as reported here. american shad in the columbia river basin import substan- tial loads and higher concentrations of marine- derived p and n rel- ative to other anadromous fishes. anadromous alewife presently import 40 kg p year−1 but previously imported 100 kg p year−1 or more into bride lake, a 28.7- ha lake that flows into long island sound, connecticut (west et al., 2010). in the wood, kvichak, egegik and ugashik rivers flowing into bristol bay, alaska, adult sockeye salmon imported from 11,700 to 50,200 kg p year−1 and 92,300 to 397,000 kg n year−1 (moore & schindler, 2004). in my study, american shad spawning adults contributed a higher percentage of p than anadromous alewife (0.42% wet weight (durbin et al., 1979; west et al., 2010), sockeye salmon (0.36–0.48% moore & schindler, 2004) and atlantic salmon (salmo_salar; 0.37–0.47%; ebel, leroux, robertson, & dempson, 2015). larkin and slaney (1997) used a com- bined % p of 0.35% for five species of salmon in british columbia, canada. previous nutrient flux studies that applied equal % p values to pre- and postspawner adults erroneously concluded that fish are unconditionally net p sources. however, with ontogenetic differences in % p applied, fish were unconditional p sinks (ebel et al., 2015). i similarly found higher % p in american shad juveniles and postspawn- ers compared to upstream migrants as reported for atlantic salmon 320  |     (ebel et al., 2015). despite ontogenetic differences in % p, my results indicate that while shad can act as net p sinks when adult returns are low and juvenile abundance is high, shad are usually net importers of both p and n to the crb. based on stoichiometric ratios, my data suggest that p is the lim- iting nutrient in john day reservoir from january to june, but that n and p are co- limiting during the second half of the year. although 16:1 is generally indicated by redfield (1958) as the ratio below which limitation switches from p to n, more recent studies suggest a broader transitional zone of co- limitation. in experiments conducted by ptacnik, andersen, and tamminen (2010), din:dip ratios in the range of 19–53 were within a transitional zone of co- limitation. in relation to these findings, my data suggest that p limiting conditions prevail from march thru may, but for the rest of the year, john day reservoir exhibits co- limitation of n and p (figure 8). my results also indicate that the lower columbia river has become increasingly p- limited since the 1990s—changes likely due to reductions in p in de- tergents and better wastewater treatment. seasonal n:p ratio trends were similar downstream at rkm’s 85 and 243 indicating broadly sim- ilar seasonal nutrient trends in the mainstem columbia river (wise et al., 2007). however, while stoichiometric ratios suggest p limitation in the columbia river, persistently detectable phosphate could other- wise indicate that phytoplankton may not be nutrient limited (gilbert, needoba, koch, barnard, & baptista, 2013; sullivan, prahl, small, & covert, 2001). although studies estimating nutrient fluxes of anadromous fish such as this one are increasingly prevalent, relatively few studies have placed nutrient loads from fish into a biogeochemical context. anthropogenic sources of n and p have increased significantly in the last 30 years, entered waterways and led to a host of environmental problems—particularly in coastal zones. in a typical year, agricultural application of nitrogen can exceed 336 kg/ha in the columbia basin (frans, 2000). while the fluxes that we estimated for nonnative shad are substantial relative to other anadromous fish, they are generally small in comparison to anthropogenic nutrient loading. this study represents a situation where nutrient fluxes from a di- minishing native conveyor have been replaced by those from a nonna- tive fish. i found few other examples which quantified nutrient flux of nonnative anadromous species. however, in tributaries of lake ontario, new york, naturalised coho (o. kisutch) and chinook salmon have re- placed once extirpated, but now reintroduced atlantic salmon. in these nonnative spawning populations, p additions from carcasses were small (<1%/year) relative to the annual p discharge but much larger (>50%/ day) during restricted periods in spring (rand, hall, mcdowell, ringler, & kennen, 1992). similarly in my study, shad flux accounted for <0.2% of the annual river—p discharge from mcnary dam, but shad could ac- count for more than 148% of the daily river p load in september when mcnary dam discharge is seasonally low. during mid- june thru mid- july when adult shad are arriving in john day reservoir, total modelled p import from shad ranged from 7.9% to 67.4% of daily river p dis- charge. net imports of nitrogen and phosphorus from american shad apparently cannot stimulate productivity of key organisms within the food web, because unlike salmon, the nutrients and carcasses are not haskell transported into tributaries where carcass retention and other well- studied processes distribute nutrients and energy more broadly across the spatial–temporal taxonomic landscape. acknowledgements washington state university provided support through a national science foundation gk- 12 fellowship to craig haskell. i also thank the usgs western fisheries research center for providing funds for the analysis of n and p concentrations in american shad tissues. i acknowledge dean ballinger of the pacific sates marine fisheries commission for data collected at the bonneville dam smf. david hallock of the washington state department of ecology provided nutrient data. i also acknowledge lisa weiland of the usgs for labo- ratory assistance and fish collection. i thank john harrison, dave beauchamp, steve bollens and brian tissot for helpful comments on this manuscript. the global biogeochemistry class at washington state university vancouver provided helpful input on the original de- velopment of this work. any use of trade, firm or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the u.s. government. references blomqvist, s., gunnars, a., & elmgren, r.
