[possibly ligula intestinalis (l.)], one trematode, diplostomum sp., and two nematode parasitic worms, eustrongylides sp. [possibly eustrongylides gadopsis (royal society of south australia, 64, 340)] and contracaecum sp. are reported from galaxias maculatus inhabiting a permanent freshwater lake and two intermittently ﬂowing, saline rivers in southwestern australia. worms infecting ﬁsh are all larval; the deﬁnitive hosts are piscivorous waterfowl. ligula sp. infected 12% of ﬁsh in the lake. effects of infection include reduced lifespan, signiﬁcant weight reduction of gonads of males and females and body weight of females. infection reduces the proportion of males that attain spawning gonad stage more severely than it does in females. the prevalence and intensity of ligula sp. infection were much less in the rivers. the infection of pseudogobius olorum (sauvage 1880) by this cestode is reported for the ﬁrst time in western australia. trematodes were much more benign in their effect on g. maculatus. a. chapman1, r. p. hobbs2, d. l. morgan1, h. s. gill1 1centre for fish and fisheries research, school of biological sciences and biotechnology, murdoch university, murdoch, perth, wa, australia, 2school of veterinary and biomedical sciences, murdoch university, murdoch, perth, wa, australia key words: ligula sp.; plerocercoids; reduced lifespan; gonad and body weight loss andrew chapman, p.o. box 264, ravensthorpe, wa 6346, australia; e-mail: ﬁshymaster@optusnet.com.au accepted for publication june 22, 2006 introduction the spotted minnow, galaxias maculatus, is a small, scaleless, galaxiid with a widespread southern hemi- sphere, circumpolar distribution that includes austra- lia, new zealand, south america and the falkland, lord howe and chatham islands (berra et al. 1996). in western australia, it occurs on the south coast between the walpole river (34 °59¢s, 116 °45¢e) and the thomas river (33 °50¢s, 123 °00¢e) with one west coast record from the harvey river (33 °05¢s, 115 °40¢e) (morgan et al. 2005). parasitism of freshwater ﬁsh in natural environ- ments in australia has not been the subject of extensive research. the most recent treatment of the subject is by humphrey & langdon (1986), which addressed mainly parasites of ﬁsh in aquaculture but also included two papers, callinan (1986) and harris (1986) pertinent to ﬁsh in natural environments. beumer et al. (1983) list 15 species of protozoan, helminth and trematode parasites from ﬁve species of australian galaxias of which nine are recorded from g. maculatus but none from western australia. pollard (1974) examined cestode and nematode parasitism of g. maculatus from lake modewarre in southwest victoria and reported the ﬁrst record for the australasian region of ligula intestinalis. pollard (1974) also reported parasitism by the larval stage of eustrongylides sp. (possibly eustrongylides gadopsis) in the visceral peritoneum. morgan (2003) reported the ﬁrst record of l. intestinalis from western australia from infected galaxias truttaceus valenciennes (1846) and g. maculatus from moates lake. the aims of this study were to identify some parasites of g. maculatus in western australia and determine their effects on host ﬁsh including deter- mination of which size/age classes are predominantly infected and how different habitats inﬂuence preval- ence and severity of infection. in particular, previous suggestions that brackish-saline waters reduce the prevalence of cestode infection and that it is limited to smaller ﬁsh in some situations were examined. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00198.x 559 chapman et al. materials and methods three sites, one a permanent freshwater lake, moates lake and two intermittently ﬂowing, brackish-hyper- saline rivers, the jerdacuttup and oldﬁeld rivers, were intensively sampled. a sample of 50+ ﬁsh was netted by 10 m seine net with a 3-mm mesh from each site monthly over an 18-month period as part of a wider study of g. maculatus. study sites moates lake is a permanent freshwater lake located in two peoples’ bay nature reserve approximately 30 km east of albany, western australia at 34 °58¢s, 118 °07¢e. electrical conductivity (ec) of lake water )1 for the duration of ranged from 0.75 to 1.6 msæcm this study. the jerdacuttup river site is a semi-permanent pool approximately 15 km east to northeast of ravens- thorpe, western australia at 33 °33¢s, 120 °09¢e. the ec range of river water was 11.0–63.0 msæcm )1. the oldﬁeld river site is a permanent pool at 33 °33¢s, 120 °32.00¢e, approximately 46 km east of ravensthorpe, western australia. the ec range of )1. ec data are from river water was 28.3–94.2 msæcm chapman et al. (2006). laboratory procedures total and standard lengths (tl and sl) of ﬁsh were measured to the nearest millimetre and ﬁsh were wet weighed to 1 mg. fish were previously preserved in 75% ethanol. parasites were removed, counted and weighed to the nearest milligram concurrently with gonadal dissection and examination. only parasites evident in the coelomic cavity or encysting internal organs were considered in this study. parasites weighing <0.001 g were assigned an arbitrary weight of 0.0005 g. ligula sp. were identiﬁed by the furrowed scolex dome with the furrow extending down both sides of the body. the body is also transversely annulated. identiﬁcation was assisted by reference to and com- parison with the scanning electron microscope image in morgan (2003). prevalence of infection and relative (% cestode weight ¼ cestode weight/ﬁsh mass weight ) cestode weight · 100) were recorded. nematodes and trematodes were identiﬁed by rh at the murdoch university veterinary parasitology labor- atory with reference to the original descriptions in johnston & mawson (1940) and smith & hickman (1983). nematodes were cleared for identiﬁcation with lactophenol. gonad stages are according to the criteria of laevastu (1965) i.e., stage i – virgin, stage ii – maturing virgin, stage iii – developing, stage iv – developed, stage v – mature or gravid, stage vi – 560 spawning and stage vii – spent. sl is the straight-line distance from the snout to the posterior end of the caudal peduncle. gonadosomatic index (gsi) is given by the equation gsi ¼ wet weight of gonad/wet weight of ﬁsh · 100. fish designated 0+, 1+ are in their ﬁrst and second years, respectively. results numbers of ﬁsh examined, with numbers infected by each parasite from each site are given in table 1. cestode infections – ligula sp. infection at moates lake ligula sp. was found within the coelomic cavity. with growth, they tightly envelop internal organs partic- ularly gonads and intestine causing both internal distortion and external disﬁguration. infection preval- ence was 12.4%. forty-one per cent were females ranging from 40 to 76 mm tl. males ranged from 36 to 61 mm tl. between one and eight cestodes were present, the mean numbers of parasites per infected ﬁsh were 2.6 for males and 2.6 for females. the relative mass of parasite to host weight ranged from 0.19% to 114.62% (mean 28%) for males and from 0.45% to 116.90% (mean 24%) for females. seasonal prevalence were summer 7.01%, autumn 19.41%, winter 10.44% and spring nil. cestodes ranged in length and weight from 2.5 mm weighing 0.0005 g to 45 mm weighing 0.197 g. measurements of total length, ﬁsh weight, gsi and gonad weight are in table 2. fish weight is wet weight of ﬁsh less total weight of ligula sp. although these data indicate that infected ﬁsh do have reduced gonad weight and gsis, the differences are signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) for gonad weight of both sexes but gsi only for males. differences in total length and weight are signiﬁcant for females only. table 3 indi- cates percentages of infected and uninfected ﬁsh in different gonad stages. a small number of infected ﬁsh do reach gonadal stages v and vi. one stage vi female table 1. numbers of galaxias maculatus examined for parasitic infection from different sites with parasite prevalence and probability of parasites being equally distributed between sites. moates lake jerdacuttup river oldﬁeld river v2 (p ) 831 no. of galaxias maculatus examined no. of ligula sp.-infected ﬁsh 103 no. of diplostomum 98 sp.-infected ﬁsh no. of eustrongylides sp.-infected ﬁsh no. of contracaecum sp.-infected ﬁsh 16 0 825 799 0 0 0 2 3 0 1 0 196æ3 (<0æ005) 194æ0 (<0æ005) 26æ9 (<0æ005) na table 2. measurements (mean ± se) and range for ligula sp.-infected and - uninfected galaxias maculatus at moates lake. measurement infected ﬁsh uninfected ﬁsh total length (mm) males females 50.2 ± 0.79 (n ¼ 58) 53.2 ± 1.33 (n ¼ 40) 52.5 ± 1.46 (n ¼ 286) 60.5 ± 2.53 (n ¼ 426) total length range (mm) males females fish weight (g) males females gonad weight (g) 36–61 40–76 0.42 ± 0.01 0.52 ± 0.04 males females 0.011 ± 0.003 0.012 ± 0.005 gonadosomatic index (%) males females 1.81 ± 0.39 1.74 ± 0.77 30–76 30–107 0.56 ± 0.05 0.93 ± 0.13 0.035 ± 0.007 0.036 ± 0.014 6.22 ± 0.75 2.80 ± 0.81 had one cestode with relative mass to body weight of 26.0%;

seven at stage v had a mean of 2.1 cestodes with a mean relative mass of 32.8% to body weight. table 2 indicates that infected ﬁsh occupy a reduced total length range within the range of uninfected ﬁsh. the age structure of infected ﬁsh was 81% and 19% for 0+ and 1+ ﬁsh, respectively, compared with 75%, 21%, 3.9% and 0.1% for 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ ﬁsh, respectively, for uninfected ﬁsh. although this sug- gests that only younger ﬁsh are infected, the difference is not signiﬁcant (v2 ¼ 4.45, p ¼ 0.1081), but the strength of the statistical test is limited by very low expected values. a sample of 45 pseudogobius olorum (22–44 mm tl) from moates lake, which were examined for ligula sp. from january, february, april and may had nil infection. cestode infections – ligula sp. infection at southeast rivers ligula sp. prevalence at the oldﬁeld river was 0.38% with between one and four cestodes per ﬁsh. all were table 3. percentage of galaxias maculatus in each gonad stage for ligula sp.-infected and -uninfected ﬁsh at moates lake. gonad stage i ii iii iv v vi vii infected males (n ¼ 58) infected females (n ¼ 40) uninfected males (n ¼ 286) uninfected females (n ¼ 426) 23.5 31.2 17.4 11.5 43.3 23.2 10.2 26.8 61.1 42.0 12.9 0 6.3 3.4 0 8.5 11.4 0 2.4 2.4 7.3 7.3 16.1 15.0 0.4 3.5 5.6 7.3 helminth parasitism of galaxias maculatus females ranging from 64 to 132 mm tl. the larger ﬁsh was the largest ﬁsh collected from this river; it also had a nematode infection (see below). relative mass to body weight ranged from 1.63% to 7.87%. seven of 13 p. olorum (20–40 mm tl) collected in september from the oldﬁeld river were infected with between one and three cestodes. this is the ﬁrst record of ligula sp. infection of p. olorum in western australia. there was one infected p. olorum from by- catch ﬁsh from the jerdacuttup river; other infected ﬁsh, of hundreds released, may have been overlooked. trematode infections – ‘black spot disease’ infection of ﬁsh from moates lake ‘black spot disease’ is evident as small, dark, raised lesions on the skin. on removal of the lesion, metacercarial cysts of the strigeoid trematode, diplos- tomum sp. (probably diplostomum galaxiae) are encysted in the muscle. prevalence of diplostomum sp. was 11.78%. tl of infected ﬁsh ranged from 46 to 101 mm with both sexes approximately equally affected. number of metacercariae per ﬁsh ranged from one to eight with a mean of 2.2 per infected ﬁsh. seasonal prevalence were summer 1.72%, autumn 26.01%, winter 21.49% and spring nil. the percentage of infected ﬁsh varied with age, with 30.4%, 63.6%, 4.0% and 2.0% of 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ ﬁsh infected, respectively. only two ﬁsh had concurrent infections of ligula sp. and diplostomum sp. fifteen infected males and ﬁve females were at gonad stage vi, therefore it seems unlikely that infection inhibits reproductive success. nematode infections – larval nematode infection of ﬁsh from moates lake a larval nematode similar to that described by johnston & mawson (1940) as e. gadopsis was present at a prevalence of 1.93%. the nematode was encysted in the inner body wall in all, but one case where the worm was encysted in the ovary. sixty- nine per cent of infected ﬁsh were females ranging from 48 to 107 mm tl. infected males ranged from 39 to 65 mm tl number of nematodes ranged from one to four, mean number of parasites per infected ﬁsh was 1.6. relative masses ranged from 0.06% to 4.35% with a mean of 1.16%. nematodes were only found over the months february–july. two females were at gonad stage vi with nematode relative masses of 1.07% and 4.35% and one at stage vii; therefore it seems unlikely that here nematode infection success. larval eustrongylides infecting g. maculatus here were all relatively small worms; the largest was 55 mm long and weighed 0.052 g reproductive inhibits 561 chapman et al. nematode infections – larval nematode infection of ﬁsh from southeast rivers prevalence of contracaecum sp. from the jerdacuttup river was 0.24% with nematodes encysted in the inner body wall. both ﬁsh were males, 35 and 56 mm tl with one nematode each. relative masses were 0.23% and 0.29%. prevalence of eustrongylides sp. from the oldﬁeld river was 0.13% with nematodes encysted in the inner body wall. one was a female, at 132 mm tl; it was the largest ﬁsh collected from this river; it also had a ligula sp. infection. discussion all the parasitic worms found in g. maculatus in this study were larval stages of worms, which reach the adult stage in piscivorous birds. although l. intesti- nalis has twice been previously recorded in australia (see above), we are unable to categorically assign our larval cestodes to this taxon because we were unable to complete the plerocercoids life cycle experimentally. the life cycle of ligula sp. involves the voiding of eggs into the water with the faeces of piscivorous birds and their subsequent ingestion by copepods, the ﬁrst intermediate host, which in turn are eaten by ﬁsh, the second intermediate host, where they develop into plerocercoid larvae (pollard 1974). the larvae may survive for 12–14 months in their ﬁsh hosts. when ﬁsh are eaten by birds, the elevated body temperature stimulates gonadal development and the eggs are produced within 2 days. the adults usually only live in their bird hosts for up to 5 days (dubinina 1954, cited by pollard 1974). fish are also the second intermediate hosts for diplostomum sp., and are infected by external penetration of the skin by the cercariae released from an aquatic snail, the ﬁrst intermediate host (smith & hickman 1983). cestode infections as in the pollard (1974) study at lake modewarre, only adult ﬁsh at moates lake are visibly infected with ligula sp. with larger ﬁsh in the 0+ and 1+ age classes having larger and more larvae than smaller ﬁsh. the mean prevalence at lake modewarre was 46% that is far greater than 12.4% at moates lake. however, the mean number of parasites per infected ﬁsh was only 1.5 compared with 2.6 at moates lake. infection with ligula sp. appeared to be restricted to the 0+ and 1+ age classes of ﬁsh, although low sample size of older ﬁsh precluded statistical signiﬁcance. a lack of infection of older ﬁsh could be explained by higher mortality of infected ﬁsh, perhaps by increased avian predation. williams & jones (1994) suggested 562 that l. intestinalis may increase morbidity by causing a decrease in the number of muscle ﬁbres, and by reducing amino acid and glucose levels. data not shown (chapman 2003) indicate that ﬁsh of all age classes fed on the copepod intermediate hosts when the latter were abundant in the lake, so it is unlikely that feeding preferences alone explain the absence of infection in older ﬁsh. seasons although seasonal prevalence indicated nil infec- tion in spring (see above), it was likely that initial infection was in spring but not detected because of small size of cestodes, as calanoid copepods, the ﬁrst intermediate host, were super abundant in spring when compared with other (chapman 2003). infection was ﬁrst detected in summer and was maximal in autumn with nearly 20% of ﬁsh infected. the results of this study are in general agreement with those of pollard (1974) in that cestode infection was found to reduce body condition and gonadal maturation. although some infected ﬁsh from moates lake achieve reproductive condition as indicated by attainment of gonad stage v or vi, this does not necessarily mean that they successfully spawned. the survival chances of l. intestinalis-infected ﬁsh are reduced (nikolsky 1963, cited by pollard 1974) because of curtailed mobility due to disﬁguration, and they may not reach a spawning area or may be taken as prey by piscivorous birds while doing so. the present study does not provide any evidence of cestode-induced host gigantism for moates lake; however, the very few infected ﬁsh from the river sites were the largest ﬁsh collected. loot et al. (2002) reported that parasite-induced host gigantism was differentially present in different populations of roach rutilis rutilus (l.) in southwestern france. rainbow trout from europe or pollard (1974) suggested that the agents of intro- duction of l. intestinalis from the northern hemisphere to australia could have been redﬁn perch or brown_trout from north america. these were all present in lake modewarre and have been recorded as l. intestinalis hosts in the northern hemisphere. the arrival of adult l. intesti- nalis via migratory birds is most unlikely for two reasons: the adult stage is short lived (<5 days) and transequatorial migrant birds entering australia do not feed on freshwater ﬁsh. however, there are numerous piscivorous birds including grebes, cormorants, her- ons, egrets, pelicans and kingﬁshers (see barker & vestjens 1989), which are nomadic or locally very mobile and could act as deﬁnitive hosts once the parasite was introduced. morgan (2003) considered it the introduction of l. intestinalis to moates lake may have been through the release of brown or rainbow trout in the 1950s or 1960s or by a local avian host. introduction to southeast rivers, where no infected ﬁsh likely that are, or have been present, could be by white-faced heron, egretta novaehollandiae (latham 1790); little pied cormorant, phalacrocorax melanoleucos (vieillot 1817) or hoary-headed grebe, poliocephalus polio- cephalus (jardine & selby 1827) all of which are piscivorous, locally common and the former two are known galaxiid predators (barker & vestjens 1989). there is also abundant circumstantial evidence to implicate hoary-headed grebe as a major galaxiid predator (chapman 2003). variations in prevalence of l. intestinalis between different localities may be due to factors such as abundance of deﬁnitive and intermediate hosts, water temperature and salinity as well as age achieved by host ﬁsh. dubinina (1954) (cited by pollard 1974) reported that relatively high water temperature favours l. intestinalis and brackish-saline water disfavours it. brackish-saline water as well as the scarcity of calanoid copepods might account for the low pre- valence in southeast rivers. trematode infections ‘black spot disease’ caused by diplostomum spp. cysts had not been recorded in australia until smith & hickman (1983) described a new species of trematode, d. galaxiae from galaxias auratus (johnston 1883) from lake crescent in tasmania. the host for the adult ﬂuke is a piscivorous bird, the white-faced heron that was present at moates lake (jaensch et al. 1988) and was also common at the sampling sites on the oldﬁeld and jerdacuttup rivers where, however, infected ﬁsh were not recorded. prevalence of both l. intestinalis and diplostomum sp. at moates lake showed a similar seasonal trend with low numbers in summer, maximum numbers in autumn that declined in winter to none in spring. galaxias maculatus here has a short lifespan, with the majority of ﬁsh living only up to approximately 1 year. additionally, most ﬁsh in autumn are adults and most ﬁsh in spring are small juveniles (chapman et al. 2006). therefore, the seasonal prevalence of the larval worms in g. maculatus is probably primarily determined by the annual growth cycle of the ﬁsh. nematode infections the life cycles and distribution of eustrongylides and contracaecum spp. are poorly understood; deﬁnitive hosts are ardeiform birds (i.e., herons and egrets) with numerous ﬁsh species reported as intermediate hosts. the prevalence of larval eustrongylides sp. was much less at moates lake (1.93%) than it is at lake modewarre where 82% of ﬁsh were infected (pollard helminth parasitism of galaxias maculatus 1974). fish at the latter site had between 1 and 44 larval worms with a mean of 5.4 per infected ﬁsh (cf. 1.6 at moates lake). summary 1. one cestode, ligula sp.; one trematode, diplosto- mum sp.; and two nematode parasitic worms, eustrongylides sp. and contracaecum sp. are reported infecting g. maculatus in one freshwater lake and two saline rivers in southwestern australia. the cestode caused gross body distortion, reduced lifespan, weight loss of male and female gonads and somatic weight loss of females. the trematode and nematodes are less malignant in their effects on g. maculatus. 2. the prevalence and intensity of cestode infection were signiﬁcantly less in the rivers possibly because of their salinity. there was limited evidence for parasite- induced gigantism in one river but not in the lake. 3. in the lake, only smaller ﬁsh were infected by the cestode, suggesting that increased mortality of infected ﬁsh or increased susceptibility to predation by piscivorous birds. there is either acknowledgements this research was undertaken while ac was
