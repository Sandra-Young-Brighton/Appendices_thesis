endangered species; individual variability; parahucho_perryi; seasonal habitat introduction sakhalin taimen (parahucho_perryi) is a salmonid that inhabits the maritime province of siberia, sakhalin, southern kuriles, and hokkaido island (gritsenko et al. 1974; iucn 2011). sakhalin taimen was origi- nally included in the genus hucho but it has become recognised as a separate genus based on the phyloge- netic divergence of mitochondrial dna (shed’ko et al. 1996). this species is the top predator in river ecosystems; lives for more than 20 years and least 1.3 m in length (zolotukhin et al. reaches at 2000). p. perryi is iteroparous (yamashiro 1965; kimura 1966), spawning in shallow upstream loca- tions from march to june after snowmelt, and has an it anadromous form dissimilar to that of closely related hucho species (holčík et al. 1988). populations of p. perryi have been steadily declin- ing owing to habitat degradation and activities such as river improvements aimed at ﬂood control, agricul- tural land development and by-catch in the commer- cial salmon ﬁshery (rand 2006; fukushima et al. 2011). only seven river systems in hokkaido now remain that support stable populations of p. perryi (fukushima et al. 2011). the iucn’s (the interna- tional union for the conservation of nature) red list has classiﬁed p. perryi as critically endangered (cr) since 2006 (rand 2006). to reestablish p. perryi populations, natural habitat needs to be restored and existing habitat must be protected. however, to do correspondence: kentaro honda, field science center for northern biosphere, hokkaido university, aikappu akkeshi hokkaido, 088-1113, japan. e-mail: fbm ods@ﬁsh.hokudai.ac.jp 640 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0633.2012.00585.x the preferred habitat and requirements of this, p. perryi must be understood. spawning ecology, particularly spawning habitat, has dominated the ecological studies published on p. perryi to date (fukushima 1994, 2001; mori et al. 1997; edo et al. 2000; yamada et al. 2008; esteve et al. 2009; nomoto et al. 2010). however, less is known about the habitat and behavioural ecology of p. perryi fry and juveniles. we know that ﬂoodplains are important (mori & nomoto 2005) and that fry and juveniles prefer low-ﬂow sections of a river (sagawa et al. 2003), but where fry and juveniles inhabit between upstream and estuary is largely unknown. with the exception of spawning season information, we also know little about adult p. per- ryi. previous studies have focused on the anadromous form in either sakhalin or hokkaido (arai et al. 2004; edo et al. 2005; honda et al. 2010a; suzuki et al. 2011; zimmerman et al. 2011). although these studies veriﬁed the existence of anadromous ﬁsh in each region by analysing the microchemicals present in ﬁsh otoliths, the occurrence rate of anadromous ﬁsh, their ﬁrst seaward-migrating age and seaward migration frequency or its timing have not been clearly revealed. studies by sagawa et al. (2002) and seasonal stream habitat of parahucho_perryi honda et al. (2009, 2010b) have reported on ecologi- cal aspects of p. perryi other than spawning season. for example, sagawa et al. (2002) identiﬁed pools inhabited by adult p. perryi in a tributary of the te- shio river in northern hokkaido and found that those pools were characterised by a reduced ﬂow velocity, larger streambed and high (vegetation) cover com- pared to uninhabited areas. honda et al. (2010b) identiﬁed seasonal habitats used by adult p. perryi for mid-to-long periods in the bekanbeushi river system using acoustic telemetry. they classiﬁed these habitats as highly meandering, seasonal and densely vegetated with riparian plants providing thick shade in the summer and autumn. acoustic telemetry in the same river system (honda et al. 2009) revealed indi- vidual variability in the seasonal migration patterns and stream habitat use of ﬁve tagged p. perryi. addi- tionally, honda et al. (2009) indicated that high water temperatures in the summer downstream triggered escape to upstream reaches, and fukuda et al. (1992) reported increased mortality in captive p. perryi at water these short and isolated studies are inadequate in compre- hensively describing migration patterns and the environmental factors affecting them. temperatures above 20 °c. however, fig. 1. study site: the bekanbeushi river system in eastern hokkaido island, japan. each area is colour-coded. the star indicates the loca- tion where parahucho_perryi captured in lake akkeshi were released. 641 honda et al. here, we described the behavioural ecology of adult p. perryi in the bekanbeushi river system using acoustic telemetry as in honda et al. (2009). by expanding the study area, we sought to quantify habitat use and variability and to explore differences in stream habitat use as determined by sex or body size. we also explored the inﬂuence of high summer temperatures on p. perryi habitat selection. methods study site surveys were conducted in the bekanbeushi river system (total basin area: 738.8 km2) in eastern to november 2008– hokkaido, japan, from april 2010 (fig. 1). the main river (bekanbeushi river) ﬂows into brackish lake akkeshi (circumference: salinity: 25– 24.8 km, maximum depth: 7.0 m, 30 psu; hokkaido institute of environmental sci- ences 2005). the lake is connected to the paciﬁc ocean by akkeshi bay (fig. 1). this basin has few artiﬁcial structures, and the dominant habitat in the lower reaches of the river basin is the bekanbeushi wetlands (5277 ha), the ramsar convention. much of upstream habitat is also intact, given that the area has restricted access because of the presence of the yausubetsu japanese army train- ing area (16,800 ha). according to honda et al. (2010b), as one moves downstream, the bekanbeushi river becomes deeper, less sinuous and has reduced amounts of riparian vegetation. the effectiveness of acoustic telemetry in targeting adult p. perryi in this river system has been conﬁrmed previously (honda et al. 2009, 2010b). registered under the entire bekanbeushi river system was included in our study area except for the oboro and obetsu rivers (fig. 1). the estuary of the oboro river was initially selected as a study site in 2009 and 2010. in an effort to conserve remaining populations of p. perryi, the actual locations where ﬁsh were caught and released cannot be given. rather, information on locations is described using river domain blocks (areas). the study sites were grouped into six areas based on channel length, junctions, and downstream tidal effects as in honda et al. (2010b). lake akkeshi was included and categorised as area 7 (fig. 1). area 1 was located 30 km upstream of the river mouth, considering the total channel length summed over the main channel and tributaries. the region from the border of area 1 to the two junctions between the bekanbeushi river and the toraibetsu (chanbetsu) river was divided into upper (area 2) and lower (area 3) areas. the lower border of area 3 was 20 km from the river mouth. downstream reaches were divided into three areas based on changes in the ﬂow velocity 642 from tidal ﬂuctuations. area 4 extended from the bekanbeushi river–toraibetsu river junction to a point 8 km from the river mouth, where the ﬂow velocity did not change with the tide. within the tide-affected area, the region that extended from the border of area 4 to the bekanbeushi river–chiraikar- ibetsu river junction was deemed area 5, and the region from the river junction to the river mouth was designated area 6 (fig. 1). in addition, the chiraikar- ibetsu river was divided into two areas (upper: area 4 and lower: area 5) at a point 6.8 km from the river mouth, where the river width decreased to less than half its maximum. the estuary of the oboro river was designated area 6. when the river system was divided into three stream habitat types, areas 1–3, 4– 5 and 6–7 were deﬁned as up-, mid- and downstream habitat, respectively. if only two classiﬁcations were used, areas 1–4 and 5–7 were the upper and lower reaches, respectively. fish capture and tag attachment from late april to early may 2008–2010, 34 mature p. perryi were captured using a seine net design (1.0 m high 9 28.1 m wide, mesh size: 40 mm) at the upstream end of a tributary in which p. perryi spawn, located 51 km from the river mouth (area 1) (table 1). a ﬁshway was placed along the riverbank with an entrance located at the upstream side of the net to target ﬁsh moving downstream. an additional, 11 adult p. perryi were caught by a local set-net ﬁsh- ery in lake akkeshi from the middle of april to the middle of may over the 3 years. in total, 45 ﬁsh were caught (15 each year); 23 ﬁsh were male and 11 each were female and unknown (table 1). the sex of each ﬁsh was determined using physical characteristics and by pressing the abdomen to determine if unreleased gametes were present. fork lengths (fls) of tagged ﬁsh ranged from 46.0 to 83.9 cm, and the mean fl (±sd) was 62.7 ± 8.9 cm. the identity of each ﬁsh was described with regard to sex, fl, capture/release location and year tagged. a vemco v13-1l acoustic tag (69.0 khz, 13.0 mm diameter, 36.0 mm length; vemco, shad bay, ns, canada) was surgically implanted into abdominal cavity of all captured p. perryi using anaesthesia (2-phenoxyethanol 0.04%, diluted with river water) as in honda et al. (2009, 2010b). battery life and pulse varied between the two types of tag used. one randomly transmitted a set of six pulses once every 20–60 s lasting 439 days, the other sent pulses every 40–90 s, with power lasting 650 days. the tagged ﬁsh caught upstream were released just below the net after conﬁrming recovery from anaesthesia, while the tagged ﬁsh caught in lake akkeshi were released at the nearby lakeshore follow- ing recovery (fig. 1). both laboratory and ﬁeld studies table 1. fish id, measurements, and tagging information for tagged adult parahucho_perryi captured in an upstream

april to 19 may in the years 2008–2010, 25– 28 stations were arrayed from area 1 to area 7, and a vemco vr2(w) acoustic receiver was deployed at each station using sandbags, rope and a buoy (table 2). deployment of all receivers was completed when tagged ﬁsh began to be released from upstream, by 26 april in all years with three exceptions (station 5 completed on 15 may in 2008, and stations 15 and 16 both completed on 19 may in 2009). receivers were closely spaced in the junctions of rivers to ade- quately capture the movements of tagged ﬁsh in both the main channel and its primary tributaries. the detection range of receivers varied with changes in bed structure, ﬂow velocity and water level. although the detection range in area 1 was 30 m, that in area 6 643 honda et al. r e t a w . p m e

(stowaway tidbit vr.1 or hobo pendant; onset computer corporation, bourne, ma, usa) were attached to receivers and recorded the ambient water temperature 1 m below the surface every 30 min (accuracy: ±0.1 °c) (table 2). receivers and water temperature loggers were retrieved after obtaining data by the end of november. however, three station receivers (3, 4 and 18) deployed in 2010 were recovered early between 31 may and 1 june 2010 (table 2). an additional receiver was towed by canoe one or more times between area 2 and the end of area 6 in each study month in all years. canoe location was logged using a garmin etrex legend or gpsmap 60csx global positioning system (gps) (http:// www.germin.com) enabling ﬁsh locations to be deter- mined in real time. data obtained by the mobile receiver supplemented those captured by the static receivers. the the mobile receiver was towed were 44, 45 and 43 in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, and the respective mean ± sd towed 9.2 ± 3.5, 9.2 ± 4.4 and 8.4 ± 3.6 km. total number of days distances were that use of detection data monthly data were categorised by season: april– june, july–september and october–november were deﬁned as spring, summer and autumn, respectively, as in honda et al. (2010b). detection data recorded in the second year after ﬁsh release were not included in any analyses. data gathered immediately following the ‘downward migration from spawning grounds’ deﬁned in the following section were not used for any analyses except the following section. downward migration from spawning grounds in this analysis, only data obtained from tagged ﬁsh released upstream were used. the completion of downward migration from spawning grounds was deﬁned as the time when a ﬁsh was not detected by any receiver except for one within a day after the last detection by that same receiver. any downward migration more than 10 days since a ﬁsh was released was not included in the analysis. areas vis- ited and time spent by each tagged ﬁsh during down- ward migration were compared according to sex and body size (fl). to estimate the time of migration, the ﬁrst detection of each ﬁsh at each station was extracted and instances counted. those data were divided into dawn, day, dusk, and night, and their frequencies of occurrence were com- pared. dawn and dusk were classiﬁed as 1 h before and after sunrise and sunset each day, respectively, counted and seasonal stream habitat of parahucho_perryi while day and night comprised the rest of the diurnal cycle. residence time in this study, the ‘residence time’ in each area was estimated on either a monthly or individual basis to examine seasonal differences in stream habitat use by tagged ﬁsh. residence time was calculated as the per- centage of time that each tagged ﬁsh stayed in each area per day. percentages for periods without detec- tion were shared half and half between the area of detection before and the area of detection after the no detection period (honda et al. 2009). some upstream reaches were not captured by receivers; therefore, when a ﬁsh was detected at an uppermost station after two or more days since being detected (at the same station), the area the ﬁsh stayed was designated as an ‘unknown area’, except for the ﬁrst and last day of the no detection period. for these 2 days, the location was assumed to be the last and next place detected, respectively, because of the low possibility for movement to other up- or midstream areas. in 2008, (including the estuary of a missing receiver at station 30 in 2008 limited the monitoring of ﬁsh movements from area 6 to area 7. therefore, if a tagged ﬁsh was detected at station 29 after  1 h following detec- tion at station 29, the area the ﬁsh stayed in for the no detection period was designated ‘unknown areas 6–7’ the oboro river) except for the ﬁrst and last 30 min of the no detec- tion period because of the probability that the ﬁsh moved to area 7. one hour was chosen (30 min on either side of no detection) because of the much higher frequency of movements in the estuary near the bekanbeushi river mouth compared with mid- or upstream reaches (honda, unpublished data). similarly, when a tagged ﬁsh was detected at sta- tion 32 on the border between lake akkeshi (area and akkeshi bay after  1 h since being 7) detected at station 32, the area the ﬁsh stayed was designated ‘unknown areas 7–bay’ except for the 30 min on either side of the no detection period. additionally, following ﬁnal detections were excluded, in cases when ﬁsh sur- vival was conﬁrmed in the second year following release and when the ﬁnal detection location was known, the ﬁsh was considered to have remained in the area until the end of the study period in the ﬁrst year. even though data the residence time was also calculated for each stream reach (up-, mid-, and downstream) and for the main channel and its primary tributaries (toraibetsu, chanbetsu, chiraikaribetsu, and oboro rivers). we also counted the number of primary tributaries each ﬁsh visited. to explore whether tagged ﬁsh released upstream appeared in nonspawning streams, the 645 honda et al. channel between the uppermost reach of their spawn- ing stream and the mouth of the bekanbeushi river was deﬁned as the ‘spawning river’. we counted the number of spawning and nonspawning rivers visited by tagged ﬁsh. nonspawning rivers were limited to primary tributaries of the main stream or of the spawning river that met with either the spawning river or the main channel in areas 4–6. to protect p. perryi populations, the residence time in each river or tributary are not shown, but numbers of tributaries each ﬁsh stayed in are given. only ﬁsh tracked for more than 30 days during the study period were used for this analysis, and a visit or stay required  12 h in a particular tributary. individual variability to verify individual variability among the three stream reaches where tagged ﬁsh visited, seasonal composition ratios of residence time in the three reaches were compared for each individual ﬁsh. in this analysis, we used data for ﬁsh tracked for more than half of each season. pairwise comparisons for the proportion of stay in each reach in all seasons were conducted one by one for each tagged ﬁsh using r ver. 2.12.2 (pairwise.prop.test), which is a free software environment maintained by the r development core team (http://www.r-project.org/). to test for differences in the resulting proportions, fisher’s exact test (a = 0.01) was used. we then tab- ulated which comparisons were and were not statisti- cally different. the maximum and minimum comparison results were then assessed using a chi- squared test. in addition, the maximum and mini- mum residence times in each stream reach were com- pared to differences in sex, body size, and released point using mann–whitney u-tests and spearman rank correlation test. comparison with riverine water temperature simple logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the presence or absence of escape behav- iour to the upper reaches by tagged p. perryi based on changing water temperature using the methods in honda et al. (2009). the mean daily maximum water temperatures at stations 25, 29 and 32 in the lower reaches, for which continuous 3 years of data were available, were used as an index of inhabitable water temperature for adult p. perryi. a model was derived with kyplot 5.0 at a = 0.05 (kyenslab inc.; www. kyenslab.com) setting the mean daily maximum water temperature as the explanatory variable and the pres- ence or absence of each tagged ﬁsh as a dependent variable such that log p=ð1   pþ g ¼ b1v þ b0 (1) f 646 table 3. number of tracked parahucho_perryi in each ﬁnal migrated area from the spawning ground according to sex, and its mean total migrated distance, mean total migrated duration, and mean migration speed. number of tagged ﬁsh final migrated area male female all 1 2 3 4 5 mean (±sd) total migrated distance (km) mean (±sd) total migrated duration (days) mean (±sd) migration speed (bls 1) 3 1 8 2 1 35.7 ± 7.3 2 1 3 3 1 35.6 ± 8.2ns 5 2 11 5 2 35.7 ± 7.5 3.4 ± 2.0 2.4 ± 1.2ns 3.0 ± 1.7 0.32 ± 0.20 0.35 ± 0.16ns 0.33 ± 0.18 ns indicates no signiﬁcant difference between males and females by mann–whitney u-test (a = 0.05). where v is the mean daily maximum water tempera- ture and p and 1   p are the probabilities of occur- rence in the lower and upper areas, respectively. this analysis was carried out for the 2008–2010 study per- iod. the same analysis using 3 years of summer data was also carried out. results the numbers of tagged p. perryi detected one or more times were 12, 13 and 14 in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. the total numbers of detections by all deployed receivers were 152,397, 310,547 and 143,848 in 2008, 2009 and 2010. the numbers of tagged ﬁsh tracked in mid-november or later each year were eight, eight and six (table 1). although three and m462r10) were ﬁnally detected at stations in areas 1, 3 and 3 on 10 october 2009, 26 october 2010 and 26 may 2010, respectively, because the survival of these individuals was conﬁrmed the following year, they were assumed to have stayed in the upper chan- nel or other areas lacking receiver coverage for the duration between detections.

(fig. 7). meanwhile, the spring and autumn residence time in downstream habitat for individuals released from lake akkeshi was signiﬁcantly higher than that for individuals released upstream (fig. 7). addition- ally, although not all the signiﬁcant differences were detected, smaller ﬁsh tended to stay upstream whereas larger ﬁsh preferred the mid- and down- stream reaches from spring to autumn (fig. 8). comparison with riverine water temperature water temperatures at the upper stations tended to lower than those at the lower stations throughout the study period, especially in 2008 and 2010 (fig. 9). simple logistic regression analysis showed that tracked ﬁsh moved away from lower areas when the mean daily maximum water temperatures increased in 2008 and 2010 (fig. 10a,c). this trend was not detected in 2009 (fig. 10b); however, it was observed in the 3 years of summer data when tracked ﬁsh again moved out of certain reaches when the water temperature rose (fig. 10d). the daily maxi- mum water temperature in the lower reaches in sum- mer 2009 ﬂuctuated less than during the other two summers. the mean (±se) differences in daily maxi- mum temperature between summers 2008 and 2009, and between summers 2009 and 2010, were 2.0 ± 2.2 and 2.9 ± 2.2 °c, respectively (fig. 11). the mean daily maximum water temperature in the lower reaches exceeded 20 °c in 6 days in 2009, 26 days in 2008 and 52 days in 2010. discussion previous telemetry research exploring the seasonal migration patterns and stream habitat use of p. per- ryi in the bekanbeushi river system was conducted by honda et al.

(2008) tracked 27 s. salar kelts (48.5–76.7 cm total length) during downward migrations after spawning and reported migratory paths of 24 km up to coastal waters over periods of 3–32 days (mean: 14 days). nocturnal migratory patterns in migration from spawning grounds have been identiﬁed in s. trutta kelts (evans 1994; bendall et al. 2005). others have identiﬁed the postspawning habitat of some iterop- arous salmonid species (bendall et al. 2005; hubley et al. 2008; jensen & rikardsen 2008) many of which (e.g., s. salar or s. alpinus kelts) prefer brackish and/or coastal waters. conversely, cutthroat trout (oncorhynchus clarki), bull trout (salvelinus conﬂuentus) and brook_trout (salvelinus_fontinalis) kelts prefer to stay in rivers and exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences from upstream to downstream during their postspawning season (jakober et al. 1998; curry et al. 2002; östergren & rivinoja 2008). seasonal stream habitat of parahucho_perryi table 6. number of tracked parahucho_perryi, the number of combinations, results of fisher’s exact test among combinations of tracked individuals as a test function of pairwise comparisons for proportions of the residence time in three stream (up-, mid- and downstream) habitats, and results of chi-square tests between the number of combinations with p < 0.01 and p  0.01 by fisher’s exact test in each season or all seasons during 2008–2010. 2008 2009 2010 spring summer autumn all season spring summer autumn all season spring summer autumn all season no. of ﬁsh no. of combinations 11 55 10 45 8 28 8 28 the results of fisher’s exact test among combinations p < 0.01 n % p  0.01 n 3 % 10.7 the results of chi-square tests between p < 0.01 and  0.01 v2 17.3 <0.001 p 16.2 <0.001 33.6 <0.001 9.1 <0.01 22 78.6 6 21.4 36 80.0 9 20.0 49 89.1 6 10.9 25 89.3 11 55 47 85.5 8 14.5 10 45 9 36 33 73.3 12 26.7 28 77.8 8 22.2 9 36 29 80.6 7 19.4 11 55 49 89.1 6 10.9 8 28 8 28 22 78.6 6 21.4 24 85.7 4 14.3 8 28 18 89.3 3 12.0 27.7 <0.001 9.8 <0.01 11.1 <0.001 13.4 <0.001 33.6 <0.001 9.1 <0.01 14.3 <0.001 17.3 <0.001 postspawning habitats and the length of time required for the downward migration from spawning grounds varies depending on the species. nighttime migration may help protect ﬁsh from predators such as eagles. for example, p. perryi tracked in this study avoided daytime movements, especially in upstream reaches with shallower waters and a narrower escape path. if tagged ﬁsh were to have completed downward migration in the upper channel above station 1, at 20 km below the site of release, we would not have captured their movements because of the absence of a receiver along that upper stretch of channel. con- sidering the three individuals that ﬁrst appeared at station 1, 10 or more days following release, a high probability exists that the upper channel above station 1 was also utilised as habitat throughout our study. two ﬁsh (m733r10 and f618r10) may not have completed spawning by the time of release, despite that only ﬁsh moving downward were captured. therefore, we cannot deny the possibility that those ﬁsh remained upstream and continued spawning. pre- vious records from the sarufutsu river system in northern hokkaido have shown that three female p. perryi (64.8–83.8 cm fl) stayed in an upstream tributary and spawned for over 5–8 days (y. tsuda, kinki university, wakayama, japan, unpublished data). after completing their migration from spawning grounds, ﬁsh dispersed widely and were found all the way from the upstream reaches to lake akkeshi. this movement continued until the end of november when the river began freezing (fig. 4). no ﬁsh stayed in akkeshi bay for more than 1 day, indicating that a large amount of brackish water connected to the estuary may deter p. perryi although p. perryi popu- lations in other river systems are known to show a distinct anadromous form (arai et al. 2004; suzuki et al. 2011; zimmerman et al. 2011). this ﬁnding conﬁrms that of kawamula et al.

(2010a), who suggested that most adult p. per- ryi in lake akkeshi do not move into akkeshi bay. throughout our tracking period, we found ﬁsh that changed habitat or stream reach across seasons and others that spent their entire time in a single stream reach (fig. 6, table 5). additional individual vari- ability was conﬁrmed by the composition ratios for the residence time in each stream habitat determined for all seasons in all study years (table 6). owing to their high individual variability and their wide utilisa- tion of the river system, p. perryi appears to be highly diversiﬁed and exhibits high behavioural plas- ticity. in this river system, upstream reaches have a more complex riverscape compared to downstream owing to increases in river sinuosity and the amount of riparian forest as it becomes narrower and shal- lower (honda et al. 2010b; honda, unpublished data). therefore, life strategies including the foraging strategy of adult p. perryi may be different between upstream and downstream, and also midstream habi- tat which has intermediate characteristics based on the environmental differences. probably, adult p. per- ryi can select their stream habitats depending on the conditions of individuals or on seasonal changes in their ambient environment. the two life history types (seaward migratory and freshwater resident) of sal- monids are well known and are inﬂuenced by not only genotype but also growth condition (e.g., heath et al. 1994; silverstein et al. 1997; thériault et al. 2007; nichols et al. 2008; wysujack et al. 2009). the life span of p. perryi is longer than that of other salmonid species and their habitats are limited to riv- ers or nearshore waters. growth rates of p. perryi vary widely in accordance with their long life spans (yamashiro 1965; gritsenko et al. 1974). they are 651 honda et al. fig. 7. mean residence time in each stream habitat from 2008 to 2010: (left) between male (grey; n = 13, 11, 10 and 10 in order from top) and female (white; n = 10, 7, 6 and 6) parahucho_perryi and (right) between p. perryi released upstream (grey; n = 23, 18, 16 and 16) and p. perryi released in lake akkeshi (white; n = 10, 10, 9 and 9) in each season and for all seasons. bars and * show standard devi- ations and a signiﬁcant difference tested at a = 0.05 by mann–whitney u test, respectively. not faced with the alternative habitats of sea or river, but must choose a habitat over a narrower range between river and the connected coastal zone such that they can return to spawn. for this reason, this species may have acquired habitat ﬂexibility. this sort of multiple migratory pattern has also been reported for the closely related species taimen (hucho_taimen). gilroy et al. (2010) tracked 46 adult h. tai- men for 5 years in eg-uur watershed, mongolia, by radio and acoustic telemetry. they revealed that the taimen’s home range varied from 0.5 to 93.2 km (mean ± sd, 23.0 ± 25.7 km) and that their migra- tion patterns could be divided into four groups (restricted core home range, core range with seasonal departures, core range with separate seasonal range and home range transfer). similarly, meka et al. (2003) studied the migration patterns of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus_mykiss) in the alagnak river, alaska, and reported three groups. the ﬁrst group stayed in the river, the second group stayed in the lake, and the third group consisted of ﬁsh that migrated between the river and lake. similar migratory patterns have also been observed in s. trutta and o. clarki (schmetterling 2001; zimmer et al. 2010). multiple migratory patterns in river systems may characterise not only long-living salmonid species like p. perryi, but all salmonid species that widely utilise the river system. we also found that more tracked p. perryi stayed in two or three stream habitats in spring com- pared to summer or autumn when they moved less 652 seasonal stream habitat of parahucho_perryi fig. 8. residence time of all tracked parahucho_perryi in each stream habitat from 2008 to 2010 in relation to fork lengths in each season and for all seasons (n = 33, 28, 25 and 25 from top down). spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient (r) and its p-values are shown on each graph. (table 5). gilroy et al. (2010) and meka et al. (2003) also revealed that h. taimen and o. mykiss more widely utilised rivers and moved more fre- quently in the postspawning season than at other times of year. overwintering and spawning utilise body strength and exhaust to recover in the spring, p. perryi may search for food and more desirable habitat leading to its variable movement within the river system. therefore, reserves; although differences in the residence time between males and females in each stream were not signiﬁ- cant, females moved from upstream reaches to mid- and downstream reaches in the summer (fig. 7). additionally, smaller ﬁsh tended to stay upstream longer in spring, while larger ﬁsh tended to stay downstream longer the study period throughout 653 fig. 9. relationships between mean daily water temperatures in the study period recorded by each water temperature logger and their channel lengths from the bekanbeushi river mouth during 2008–2010. honda et al.

(fig. 8). these ﬁndings may suggest that females expecting eggs in the following spring move to lower reaches to ﬁnd food and that p. perryi individuals select stream habitat appropriate for their size and life cycle. generally, salmonid females show anadromous form more than males (e.g., yamamoto et al. 1999; jonsson et al. 2001). p. perryi also shows the similar trend (honda et al. 2010a). however, considering both insufﬁcient data and large variances, more research is required to conﬁrm these speculations. the trend that ﬁsh released from lake akkeshi stayed downstream with high frequency even in the ﬁsh had previously autumn may indicate that experienced downstream habitat and knew of its advantages. this sort of seasonal site ﬁdelity of p. perryi has not been reported to date, and also that of other salmonid species has not been well studied (clapp et al. 1990; meka et al. 2003; zimmer et al. 2010). the existence of ﬁsh such as u741l08, which stayed mainly in downstream reaches in the spring, but to autumn, means that ﬁsh that use downstream habitats in the spring do not always rely on the same habitat at other times of the year. normally, these sex- and size- dependent and released place-based behaviours should be discussed together in related to their gona- dal maturities, nutritional statuses and/or the distribu- tion of food sources. thus, further study regarding remained upstream from summer 654 those traits of adult p. perryi deﬁnitive correlations. is required to draw we found that tracked p. perryi migrated to the upper reaches from lower reaches when water tem- perature in the lower reaches increased in the summer (fig. 10). this trend was true in 2008 and 2010 when the summer water temperature was relatively high in the lower reaches, but not in 2009 when the water temperature remained low throughout most of the summer. salmonids are known to avoid high water temperature because they are cold-water species (e.g., bilby 1984; torgersen et al. 1999; baird & krueger fig. 11. mean daily maximum water temperature in lower areas (areas 5–7) during each summer from 2008 to 2010. 2003). curry et al. (2002) tracked 31 s. fontinalis (30.0–47.7 cm fl) in the kennebecasis river, canada, using both radio- and acoustic telemetry, and reported that many tracked ﬁsh remained upstream (50 km from the river mouth) where the mean daily water temperature was 0.6 °c lower downstream in prespawning summer. additionally, zimmer et al. (2010) tracked 43 s. trutta (34.0–59.6 cm fl) using radio telemetry in the credit river, usa, and found that when water temperatures in the lower reach exceeded the 17.4 °c thermal preference for the spe- cies, the ﬁsh moved to upper reaches. our results indicated that high water temperatures downstream is a trigger for adult p. perryi to move upstream, sup- porting the results of honda et al. (2009). for adult p. perryi, the decision to move around in the lower reaches in hot summer probably comes with a risk as with other salmonid species (e.g., berman & quinn 1991; matthews & berg 1997). a water temperature of 20 °c is the speculated threshold temperature that triggers p. perryi to escape to cooler waters. lost, in this study, some tagged ﬁsh were not detected, and some tracked ﬁsh lost detection during the study period. because p. perryi is an endangered species, missing ﬁsh cannot be ignored. fish with no detec- tion (all released from upstream) likely inhabited the area between the point of release and station 1; how- ever, the possibility of either acoustic tag failure or ﬁsh death should not be overlooked. some ﬁsh, such as m566r08, migrated downwards to area 2 after release in the middle of may and then migrated upstream back to area 1 around early june before losing contact. similarly, f618r10, which was detected after release on 26 may at station 1 and then detected again at station 1 on 16 june, lost detection soon after. conversely, m605r09 stayed in the upper channel before ﬁnally being detected at station 1 on 10 october. moreover, f585r09 remained in areas 1 and 2 until 27 november. fish whose detection signal was lost in the middle of the study period are assumed to have stayed upstream of station 1 or in lake akkeshi. of all 17 ﬁsh whose (u800l08, m535r09 and u650l09) were ﬁnally detected in the main channel, ﬁve were only detected at stations near the bekanbeushi river mouth or in lake akke- shi and nine were last detected by the uppermost reaches stations. the survival of three individuals (m605r09, m625r10 and m462r10) was not conﬁrmed until the second year. despite the possi- bility of acoustic tag failure, ﬁsh death or being ﬁshed, a high probability exists that the remaining 11 ﬁsh survived and stayed in channels that were not covered by receivers. however, this also indi- cates that the residence time in areas 1–3 and 6–7 (fig. 4) may have been underestimated. detections were three seasonal stream habitat of parahucho_perryi this study revealed the wide use of the bekanbeushi river system, from upstream to brack- ish lake akkeshi, by adult p. perryi. not only did individuals use the main channel or their spawning rivers, many individuals also used multiple primary tributaries or nonspawning rivers. moreover, some ﬁsh stayed from spring to autumn in one stream reach while other individuals used the river system more widely. considering the above, adult p. perryi have high behavioural plasticity and their life forms show high variety in the pristine natural environment. therefore, unless their migrations in the river system are blocked, or a region of habitat made unsuitable, they would occur everywhere regardless of upstream or downstream, making maximum use of the entire space in the long and short term. therefore, the elim- ination of barriers that block migrations along stream habitats and their tributaries is absolutely essential to conserve this endangered species. the existence of barriers is known to be a threat for salmonid species with spawning grounds upstream (e.g., hindar et al. 1991; morita et al. 2009). especially in hokkaido, negative effects of habitat fragmentation caused by dams on several freshwater ﬁshes including salmonid species were previously reported (fukushima et al. 2007). through this study, the importance of the con- nectivity among p. perryi habitats became more apparent. the ability to freely migrate back and forth in rivers is more important than anything else to p. perryi. acknowledgements we thank t. sato, m. kuribayashi, k. nakano and other staff members of the fisheries cooperative association of akkeshi, s. takeyama of the akkeshi-cho oyster seedlings center and mr. m. whalen of university of california for their coopera- tion and assistance. t. shibuya and other staff members of the akkeshi waterfowl observation center, professor m. nakaoka and other staff of akkeshi marine station, hokkaido univer- sity, and a number of graduate students and undergraduate stu- dents of hokkaido university helped us greatly during the ﬁeld study. this study was supported by a grant-in-aid for the foundation of river & watershed environment management, japan (no. 20-1215-1), and a grant-in-aid for scientiﬁc research of lake akkeshi and bekanbeushi wetland (no. 23). references arai, t., kotake, a. & morita, k. 2004. evidence of down- stream migration of sakhalin taimen, hucho_perryi, as revealed by sr:ca ratios of otolith. ichthyological research 51: 377–380. baird, o.e. & krueger, c.c. 2003. behavioral thermoregula- tion of brook and rainbow trout: comparison of summer hab- itat use in an adirondack river, new york. transactions of the american fisheries society 132: 1194–1206. 655 honda et al. bendall, b., moore, a. & quale, v. 2005. the post-spawning movements of migratory brown_trout salmo_trutta l. journal of fish biology 67: 809–822. berman, c.h. & quinn, t.p. 1991. behavioural thermoregula- tion and homing by spring chinook salmon, oncorhynchus tshawystcha (walbaum), in the yakima river. journal of fish biology 39: 301–312. bilby, r.e. 1984. characteristics and frequency of cool-water areas in a western washington stream. journal of freshwater ecology 2: 593–602. clapp, d.f., clark, r.d., jr & diana, j.s. 1990. range, activ- ity, and habitat of large, free-ranging brown_trout in a michi- gan stream. transactions of the american fisheries society 119: 1022–1034. curry, a.r., sparks, d. & van de sande, j. 2002. spatial and temporal movements of riverine brook_trout population. transactions of the american fisheries society 131: 551– 560. edo, k., kawamula, h. & higashi, s. 2000. the structure and dimensions of redds and egg pockets of the endangered sal- monid, sakhalin taimen. journal of fish biology 56: 890– 904. edo, k., kawaguchi, y., nunokawa, m., kawamula, h. & higashi, s. 2005. morphology, stomach contents and growth of the endangered salmonid, sakhalin taimen hucho_perryi, captured in the sea of okhotsk, northern japan: evidence of an anadromous form. environmental biology of fishes 74: 1–7. esteve, m., mclennan, d.a. & kawahara, m. 2009. spawn- ing behaviour of sakhalin taimen, parahucho_perryi, from northern hokkaido, japan. environmental biology of fishes 85: 265–273. evans, d.m. 1994. observations on the spawning behaviour of male and female adult sea_trout, salmo_trutta l. using radio telemetry. fisheries management and ecology 1: 91–105. fukuda, y., matsuzaka, h., matsuzaka, g. & kikuya, n. 1992. productive techniques development test of cultured mature ﬁsh. annual report of aomori prefecture inland fisheries experimental station in fiscal year 1990, 29–35 (in japanese). fukushima, m. 1994. spawning migration and redd construc- tion of sakhalin taimen, hucho_perryi (salmonidae) on northern hokkaido island, japan. journal of fish biology 44: 877–888. fukushima, m. 2001. salmonid habitat–geomorphology relationships in low-gradient streams. ecology 82: 1238– 1246. fukushima, m., kameyama, s., kaneko, m., nakao, k. & steel, e.a. 2007. modelling the effects of dams on freshwa- ter ﬁsh distributions in hokkaido, japan. freshwater biology 52: 1511–1524. fukushima, m., shimazaki, h., rand, p.s. & kaeriyama, m. 2011. reconstructing sakhalin taimen parahucho_perryi historical distribution and identifying causes local extinctions. transactions of the american fisheries society 140: 1–13. for gilroy, d.j., jensen, o.p., allen, b.c., chandra, s., ganzorig, b., hogan, z., maxted, j.t. & vander zanden, m.j. 2010. home range and seasonal movement of taimen, hucho_taimen, in mongolia. ecology of freshwater fish 19: 545– 554. 656 gritsenko, o.f., malkin, e.m. & churikov, a.a. 1974. sakhalinskii taimen’ hucho_perryi (brevoort) reki bogatoi (vostochnoe poberezh’e sakhalina) izv tikhookean nauchno-issled inst rybn khoz okeanogr 93: 91–100.
