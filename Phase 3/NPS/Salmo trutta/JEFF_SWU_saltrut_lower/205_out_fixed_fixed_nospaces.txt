196 g.-toth et al. 1995; ponyi et al. 1968; sebestyen 1967). this resulted in several cyanobacterial blooms and massive fish-kills (repeated in 1965, 1975, 1982, 1991) and alterations of the nutrient supply and budget (birb 1984, biro & voros 1990) (fig. 2). major shifts in species composition and abundance of invertebrate and fish communities oc- curred through increased human pressure and en- vironmental perturbations. the latter includes re- duction of wetlands and flooded areas (tolg 1961), shoreline regulations, use of agricultural fertilizers, urbanization of the shoreline (total lakeside popula- tion increased to >600,000 ind-'), sewage input and disposal (the construction of a 110-km sewage transfer pipeline system and the total sewage treat- ment capacity of 50,000 m3 . day-' in the tourist area were planned by 1995 (virag 1988)), tourism (>20 million year-'), commercial fisheries, ang- ling, and fish stocking, including exotic fish species (biro 1984). actual lake management includes habi- tat reconstruction (kis-balaton reservoir, where fish biomass ranged between 66.9 and 296 kg ha-'), rehabilitation of native fish fauna (i.e., lake balaton and its fish populations fig. 1a. location of lake bala- ton (hungary) and its drainage area (46"62'47"04' n-17'15'- 18'10' e). kbwr=kis-balaton water quality protecting reser- voir* (total area: 87 km2) (modi- fied after biro 1985). * first step of kbwr (area i: 24 km2, mean depth: 1.14 m) was in- undated in 1985, and the second step is currently under construction (total area [11] to be inundated: 63 km2). 0 i 0 20km n fig. ib. the five fishing areas of lake balaton with indication of fishery stations and depth (m) con- tours. a=siofok (including the eel- trap in the mouth of sio-canal), b= tihany, c=balatonszemes, d= fonyod, e=keszthely. fishing areas a and b were unified during the early 1980s. s/a=shoreline- lengtwwater area ratio (modified from biro & voros 1990). phragmif- es australis stands cover almost one-half (1 10 km) of the shoreline, or 12 km2 on the northern and 3 km2 on the southern shore, ca. 2.5% of the total lake area. sub- mersed macrophytes cover about 1% of the total surface (herodek 1988). p and n loaded by river zala are 5 g . m-2. y e a r 1 and 6 g . m-z. year-l, respectively. chlorophyll-a concentration varies from 350 to 400 mg m-3. reed- grass stands (3.3 kg . m-2) cover about 50% of the water surface. the reservoir retains a high amount (total-p: 92-105 of nutrients t . year-';

herodek & 014h 1973; herodek et al. 1988; olah et al. 1977) (table 1, fig. 2). according to istvanovics (1993), bacteria may play an important role in p cycling within the sedi- ment (ca. >25%), and at the sediment-water inter- face. in recent years, an accelerated turnover time of phosphorus has typically characterized the lake. in the 1970s the average turnover time of p04-p was 2.5 days (olah et al. 1977), but it has been only a few minutes in very recent years (istvanovics & herodek 1994). habitat modifications (interrelationships among habitats, species-communities and human press- ure) and eutrophication have had the greatest in- 202 fluence on the fish populations. since the middle of the 19th century, the shape of shoreline develop- ment and the surroundings of the lake have been changed. at this time, 34 fish species were known to occur in the still oligo-mesotrophic lake (daday 1897). records prove the species richness and density fish stocks during the 19th century. regulations of water level and the disconnection (draining) of the marshy areas (nagyberek, kis-balaton) started in the 19th century and reduced the area and the diver- sity of habitats of the lake (tolg 1961). later, shore- line building resulted in hugh losses of natural spawning grounds and nursery areas (virag 1988) (fig. 1). these had a strong influence on stock-re- cruitment relationships. fish populations in lake balaton have undergone changes from the individ- ual or combined effects of habitat perturbations, eutrophication and overfishing (biro 1977, 1978b). since the early 20th century, 47 fish species have been in the lake and its drainage area. however, only 31 species have been recorded during the last three decades. thirteen non-native species have occurred since the last century. these were introduced either by official decisions for fishery purposes or for other purposes. a total of 20-24 species are common, but the fish catch contains only 15-17 species (biro 1981, 1994) (tables 2, 3). the lake is dominated by cyprinids (abramis spp., blicca bjoerkna, rutilus ru- tilus, scardinius erythrophthalmus, alburnus albur- nus, cyprinus carpio). dominant predators are: pikeperch (stizostedion lucioperca, s. volgensis), asp (aspius aspius) and wels (silurus glanis). endang- ered species or species formerly believed to be ex- tinct (e.g., the introduced micropterus salmoides and the native perca jeuviatilis) disappeared from the lake during the 1910s and 1970s, respectively. fig. 6a. the annual yield (kg . ha-' . year-') of all fish (14 species), carp (cyprinus carpio) and pikeperch (stizostedion lucio- percu) in different areas of the lake for the period 198c1995. linear regressions indicate the di- rection of temporal changes. r2= coefficient of determination. 160 140 120 i 0 0 m 80 * 60 40 20 0 2.5 - 2 . lake balaton and its fish populations all fish y = -5.0987~ + 113.21 c. carpio y = -0.0134~ + 0.3873 = 0.1527 # i # i n  i i . . - - tihany - - - - sibfok+trap bszemes - fony6d - _ _ . _ . . keszthely total sibfok+trap - - tihany - -.- b.szemes - fony6d - _ _ _ . _ . keszthely total however, at present they actually have self-sustain- ing stocks in northern and southern streams and in the reconstructed kis-balaton reservoir (biro 1981;

biro & musk6 1995). however, decreased stock size usually results in a faster rate of growth (biro 1991). comparative studies on the trophic relationships of periphyton-zooplankton-fish and periphyton- zoobenthos-fish proved significant differences be- tween the littoral zone and the open water areas. the periphyton biomass (dw/substratum) ranged from 4.1 to 36.4 g mp2 (lakatos & biro 1991), the zooplankton biomass from 0.5 to 1.9 mg ww - 1-l- month-', and that of fish from 71.6 to 90.4 kg - hap1 (simonian et al. 1995). biomass of 210 zoobenthos biomass varied from 0.1 to 20 g mp2 ww (perknyi et al. 1993). biomass and production in energetic kj values suggest that the transfer of energy from primary producers to fish in the lit- toral zone is more efficient than in the open water areas. the results are detailed in table 6. trophic relationships (both planktonic and ben- thic food webs) respond sensitively to environmen- tal and fish community changes. based on the age composition of fish communities in the littoral zone and open water areas, the significance of planktonic and benthic food webs alternate. in the littoral zone, a significant amount of energy is channelled through the periphyton-zooplanktodzoobenthos- bleak-pikeperch foodchain (bir6 1991). as a rough estimate, the bleak ( a . alburnus) stock (4.8-12.4 kg . ha-') consumes about 223-297 kj * ha-' (ne basin) and about 1236-1649 kj * hap2 (sw basin) (4.5-33.0 kj * mp2) from april to october. eleven percent of the energy may originate from zooplank- ton and ca. 89% from benthos in the ne basin. in lake balaton and its fish populations razor fish (f. cultratus) . . 3 4 5 i . . .  . 6 7 8 9 10 . - . - - - . _ _ 195166 ( e m a lukacrovics, 1957) (males) (females) - - - - - 1978 (bir6,1982) (si6fok-tihany) - 1 sf8 (bird, 1982) - 198749 (perhyi, (6alatonozemes) 199?1 fig. 7c. variations in the growth (length and weight) of the pelagic razor fish (pelecus cultratus) in lake balaton for the years indi- cated 25 20 10 15i 5 i 0 4 . 1 . 2 500 1 a 400 c -9 200 195146 (entz el lukacsovics, 1857)(males) (females) 1978 (8fr41982) (si6fok-tihany) a - - - 1978 (bir6,1982) (balatonrzemes) o j o i 2 3 4 5 6 7 age the central area of the lake, %yo of the energy may be channelled through periphytic-zooplanktonic and benthic food webs and about 14% and 86% re- spectively in the sw basin. since pikeperch (s. iuci- uperca), the top predator of lake balaton, con- sumes about 2.2-6.7 kj * mp2 ' year-' and its food consists of bleak (ca. 90-98%), it seems evident that a . alburnus has an important role in energy me- diation through the littoral food webs linked to the periphytic-planktonic-benthic communities (biro 1991, bird & musk6 1995). however, the energydis- sipates significantly in both the littoral and the open water areas, and the energy flowing through ben- thos and periphyton seems to be more important than that of the plankton community (bir6 & voros, 1990). bream (abrmis spp.) consumes about 93- 141 kj -m-2 year-' of food energy, mediating about 2-10% of food energy to the pikeperch (biro & voros 1990, biro et al. 1991). primary pro- duction of the lake increased substantially from 7.2- 17.1 kj - m-2 day-' (open water, central basin, 1960) (bosz6rmcnyi et al. 1962) to 7615-6456 kj * m-2 year-' (open water, ne basin, 1970- 1990), or to 33,890-30,264 kj - mp2 * year-' (open water, sw basin, 1970-1990) (herodek 1977; g.- toth 1992). if we consider these figures as 100% of total production, the secondary production + (plankton+benthos) in the open water from ne to sw basins (170400 kj * m-2 * year-') (ponyi 1985, 1992) transforms about 1.0-2.3% of primary en- ergy. in the littoral zone, the production of zoo- plankton from ne to sw varied from 61.8 to 618.0 kj m-2 * year-', and the transfer efficiency from 0.8 to 1.7% (simonian et al. 1995). the efficiency of energy transfer to fish varies along the longitudinal axis of the lake between 0.05% and 0.1% (open water) (biro & voros 1990), or between 0.1% and 0.4% (littoral zone) (biri, 1984; simonian et al. 1995) (table 6, fig. 8). in the reconstructed kis-balaton reservoir (1985), the fish biomass per unit of area is 66.0- 296.0 kg. ha-'. annual fish yield (2.9-12.8 kg * ha-' - yearp1) seems to reflect an underexplo- itation of the fish populations available. com- paring the gross primary production (22,279.8 kj mp2 * year-', calculated from data by pomo- gyi 1991) to fish yield (1.2-5.4 kj * mp2 - year-'), a fairly low efficiency of energy transfer of primary producers to fish is obtained: i.e., 0.0053-0.024"/. these rough estimates suggest that an "overshoot" in primary production is coupling with a reduced efficiency of fish production, and the energy dissi- pates significantly within the ecosystem (bir6 & paulovits 1994). 211 fig. 7 0 . variations in the age dis- tribution and annual growth (length and weight) of bleak (al- burnus alburnus) in lake balaton for the years indicated biro - 1968-70 (biro, 1975) - - 9 y 10 - - ..- .- - 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . y - - - ' / i  .._..- - 1 4 - - e 12- 5 10- p 8 - e 4 - q) - 6 - u c 10 2 - o + 30 - 25 - n s 20- * 5 15- -- p 10- 5 - - - i - 1986 may (bird, - - - 1966 july (bir6, 1990 a) _ _ _ _ - - - - 1990a) 1991-92 (bid b musk6, 1995) - 1968-70 (bir6, 1975) 1 - 1 1 1966 mayjuly (blr6,1990a) - - - - . - - - 1991-92 (bir6 & musko, 1995) - 1966-70 (bir6, 1976) 1 - 1 1 1966 may (bir6, 1990al - - i _ _ _ _ _ - - ~ 1986 july (birh, 199oa) 1991-92 (bird & musk6, 1995) management of fish populations management techniques and procedures for the fish populations of lake balaton have been de- scribed in detail by bir6 (1977, 1992, 1993, 1995a, b). primary issues are the reconstruction of natural shorelines and the rehabilitation of lake balaton, including invertebrate and fish stocks. strict regu- lation of fisheries, both sport and commercial, ac- cording to fish production in different lake basins and habitats will enhance a more healthy func- tioning of the whole ecosystem. selective fisheries are required to regulate the high density of bream and crucian carp. also, it is to be expected that increased stocking of predators (pikeperch, pike, and wels) would result in a more balanced fish stock in the lake. broad, long-term studies would be a major aid to correctly pre- dicting variations in fish populations, and to pro- vide sound ecological background for lake man- agement (biro 1995a, b). the functioning of the lake, however, is hin- dered by further water quality deterioration. in the winter of 1974/1975, an intensive bloom of nitzschia acicufaris developed and made up more than 50% of the extremely high total algal bio- 212 lake balaton and its fish populations table 6. energy budget of lake balaton. production of energy estimated for different trophic levels (kj . m-2 . year-') and the efficiency of transfer (%) of energy from primary producers to fish (in brackets) (modified from bira 1995b) energy level primary production: littoral zone open water secondary production: open water littoral zone fish production (yield): open water (all fish) pikeperch littoral zone (all fish) (1960): (1 961): (1 970): (1990): (1 977): (1992): (1971-80): (1 987): (1 992)"': basins ne (siofok) central basin sw (keszthely) reference 2.05-16.85* * 1.82 761 5 6456 (1 00%) 170 (2.26%) 61.84 (0.82%) 7.15-1 7.07* 2.28-3.23 1.57-2.1 6* * 33890 (100%) 30264 (1 00%) 300-400 (0.99-1.32%) 61 8 (1.7%) 3.18-4.52 (0.04-0.06%) (0.002-0.0053%) 15.0-26.5 (0.23-0.41 %) 16.3-1 9.4 (0.045-0.053%) (0.0454022%) 15.2-23.6 (0.05-0.078%) felfoldy (1961) boszijrmbnyi et al.
