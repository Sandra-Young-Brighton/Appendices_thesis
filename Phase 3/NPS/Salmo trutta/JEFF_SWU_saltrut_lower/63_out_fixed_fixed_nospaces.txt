(1993) found a positive relationship between the probability of migration per day and the number of degree-days, changes in water level and temperature during the preceding week. solomon (1981) found that down- stream movements were correlated with water level. the latter two studies were carried out in relatively small streams and did not demonstrate common lower values of the factors initiating the onset on migration of brown_trout smolt. however, other authors have observed a lower threshold temperatures for salmonid smolt migration; i.e. 10°c (osterdahl 1969), 10-12°c (solomon 1978b) and -2°c (hvidsten et al. 1995). in this study, we evaluated whether the timing 61 hembre et al. of a brown_trout smolt run in a large norwegian river was environmentally induced. in particular, we tested the hypothesis that there existed thresh- old values of water discharge and water tempera- ture for the smolt run explored over three consecu- tive years. material and methods this study was carried out during the years 1991- 1993. it took place in the river stjarrdalselva (63"20'n, 10'55'e) in central norway. the river's outlet is in the southeastern part of the fjord trondheimsfjorden. the catchment area is 2130 km2, and the mean annual discharge is 29 m3 . s-'. during the spring flood in may, the discharge nor- mally reaches about 450 m3 . s-'. the river width varies between 20 and 80 meters. anadromous s. salar and s. trutta may ascend 47 km upstream to meriker, situated at 100 m a.s.1. a trap was operated from sona bridge, 15 km upstream from the river mouth. two electric winches were used to lower the trap into the river. the trap consists of two 7 m long net pouches u a ) ji y f mu fzg 1 number of captured downstream migrating brown_trout smolts (o), water

submerged just beneath the surface in the main current. previous studies of atlantic salmon smolts have shown that fish chiefly migrate in the main current (fried et al. 1978; hesthagen & garnis 1986). the method is further described by hes- thagen & garnis (1986). the trap was operated from 2000 to 0800 hours, and the pouches were emptied at 2400, 0400 and 0800 hours every night during the study. it also operated during the day, from 0800 to 2000 hours throughout the period in 1991 and for 5 days in the 1993 period. a total of 482 smolts were captured in the trap from 28 april to 30 may in 1991,29 april to 31 may in 1992 and 26 april to 7 june in 1993. the number of brown_trout smolts was counted each time the trap was operated. daily recaptures in 1991 were divided by two, to equate the catch per effort data recorded in the following 2 years. the discharge (m3 * s-') was monitored daily at hegra, 5 km downstream from sona bridge, by the norwegian water resources and energy director- ate (nve), which also monitored the water tem- perature at dawn and dusk at 0verki1, some 3 km upstream from sona bridge. results most smolts were caught during 7-10 days in the middle (1991) or second half of may (1992 and 1993) (fig. 1). water discharge varied considerably from year to year. few smolts descended until about 12 may in both 1991 and 1992 regardless of interannual differences in discharge. in 199 1, the discharge was roughly constant at about 30 m3 * s-l in the period 27 april-12 may, whereas it first increased and then decreased from about 200 to 50 m3 - s-l during the same period in m3 * s-' 1992. the water temperature was slightly higher in 1991 (-4.5"c) compared to 1992 (-2.5"c) until 12 may. in contrast, about three times as many smolts were captured during the same period in 1993 when the discharge was higher (80-300 m3 s-i) and the temperature was slightly lower compared to the previous years (fig. 1). in 1993, there was a period (26 may to 5 june) with low discharge (40- 50 m3 * s-') and few smolts were captured. a rise in the discharge at the end of this period, coincided with an increase in the smolt migration. overall, there seems to be a trend towards in- creased migration at about 50 m3 . s-' and 4°c (fig. 1). below these values, few smolts migrated. the maximum numbers were recorded at inter- mediate discharge (70-150 m3 . s-') and high water temperature (g3"c). moreover, at high dis- charge (e.g. 100 m3 s-i) and increased water tem- effect of water discharge and temperature on migration table 1. results of stepwise

rose with increasing discharge. at higher water temperatures most smolts were captured at 100-150 m3 * s-'. in 1993, there was an interrelation between dis- charge and temperature, but this did not occur in the other two years. multiple regression analysis indicated that discharge explained 38% of the vari- ation in the number of smolts migrating in 1991. discharge and temperature together explained 61% in 1992 and 28% in 1993, respectively (table 1). thus, the relative importance of these two fac- tors varied from year to year. in 1991, most smolts were captured at relatively high water temperatures and low discharge. in 1992 when the discharge was high and the tem- perature moderate, and in 1993 when the discharge was relatively high and the temperature low. these data suggest that, though their main descent oc- curred at about the same time each year, a complex set of interactions exists between water discharge, temperature, and the downstream migration of brown_trout smolts. discussion the daily number of descending smolts captured was significantly correlated with the mean dis- charge in all three years. very few smolts de- scended when the discharge was low (<50 m3 * s-') and water temperature <4"c. however, when either of these variables remained constant, the number of smolts captured rose with the increasing value of the other variable. thus, the smolts seemed to react to discharge and temperature in combination. however, the maximum intensity in the smolt run occurred during 7-10 days in the second half of may. similar period of maximum movements was shown for reared brown_trout smolts in an experimental tank at laukaa (62" 27") in finland (pirhonen et al. 1998). a positive correlation between the downstream migratory fish and increased water discharge has also been demonstrated in several other studies of salmonids (osterdahl 1969; solomon 198 1; hart- man et al. 1982; irvine 1986; greenstreet 1992; bohlin et al. 1993). the downstream migration of smolts would not necessarily be initiated by water discharge but also by changes in environmental conditions connected with water discharge, such as turbidity (solomon 1978b; greenstreet 1992). a rise in water discharge and changes in water chemistry can be the proximate factor to initiate smolt migration mainly in two ways. these are either passive or active downstream migration. sol- omon (1978a) suggested that the smolt migration of atlantic salmon is an active process as a re- sponse to environmental conditions. a conse- quence is that the smolt is able to distinguish be- tween optimal and suboptimal environmental con- ditions through their downstream migration, thus enabling them to reach the sea when conditions are favorable (see heggberget et al. 1993). other authors have hypothesized that smolt migration is a passive process in salmonids (crittenden 1994; pirhonen et al. 1998). in that case, we had expected that high or increased discharge early in the study period had resulted in higher numbers of smolts. our results have shown that water discharge is an important proximate factor for initiating smolt mi- gration, but low catches at high water discharge in early may both in 1992 and 1993 suggest that the smolt runs may be an active process. moreover, our results indicate a threshold tem- perature (4°c) for the major descent of brown_trout smolts. in the period 29 april to 11 may 1992, few smolts descended in spite of relatively high water discharge (>50 m3 * s-') and low tem- perature (24°c). osterdahl (1969) and solomon (1978b) observed that the downstream migration of atlantic salmon was initiated when the tem- perature reached 10°c. in contrast, in the river orkla, which is located in the vicinity of the river stjrardalselva, hvidsten et al. (1995) observed that the atlantic salmon smolt migration was initiated at 2 4 c . we did not sample when the temperature was <2"c, but we caught smolts on the first day we sampled every year. there are indications that the smolt migration of anadromous brown_trout is initiated at temperature of >2"c in the river 63 hembre et al. stjm-dalselva and that there is an increase in the number of descending smolts when the tempera- ture exceeds 4°c. in an experimental test of move- ments of reared brown_trout smolts, pirhonen et al. (1998) found no threshold temperature as downstream displacement increased as soon as temperature started to rise. the temperature varied between 2°c and 16°c in their study. how- ever, the latter and our study showed most intense movements between 6°c and 8-1ooc, but some- what lower than reported for smolt movements of trout populations further south (chelkowski et al. 1994; moore & potter 1994). in the stj~rdalselva, we found a significant posi- tive correlation between the water temperature and the number of downstream migrating smolts in 1992 and 1993. this coincides with fish species de- scending rivers (white 1939; solomon 1978a, b; haraldstad et al. 1985; irvine 1986). also, white (1 939) observed a positive correlation between the number of downstream migrating atlantic salmon smolts and water temperature during a period of stable water discharge. for 3 years, we found simi- lar behavior in anadromous brown_trout smolts. an explanation for this may be that the positive reothaxis decreases with increasing water tempera- ture, as hoar (1976) observed in chum salmon (oncorhyncus keta) fry. this may also indicate that the downstream migration in smolts is an active behavior. resumen 1. durante tres afios consecutivos, estudiamos el descenso de smolts de de una poblacion de salmo truttu anadroma de un rio noruego. el mayor descenso se produjo durante un period0 de siete a diez dias de la mitad, o de la segunda mitdd de mayo. los datos obtenidos son consistentes con la hipotesis de que incre- mentos en el caudal y en la temperatura estimulan el descenso. 2. algunos individuos descendieron a bajos niveles de caudal ( 4 0 m3 . s-l) y a bajas temperaturas (<4"c), per0 el maximo numero fuc capturado a niveles moderados de caudal (70-150 m3 . s-') y altas temperaturas (6-8°c). 3. la importancia relativa de estos factores cambio de afio en aiio. la primera descarga del afio explico 38% de la variacion en el nimero de smolts migrando aguas abajo, mientras que el caudal y la temperatura juntas explicaron el 61% en 1992, y el 28% de la variacion en el segundo y en el tercer afio de estudio. acknowledgments this work was financially supported by
