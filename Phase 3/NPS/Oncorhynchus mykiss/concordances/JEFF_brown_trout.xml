    <right>(hereafter trout) and whitefish (coregonus lavar- etus (l.)) often occur sympatrically in large lakes. in these lakes, charr and trout are able to use whitefish as their prey. many studies have revealed that in sympatric occurrence, the habitat of trout and charr are segregated (hegge et al. 1989; langeland et al. 1991; langeland &amp; l'-abe ́ e-lund 1996). trout is more aggressive and competitively superior to charr, forcing them to less suitable habitat (hegge et al. 1989; nilsson</right>

    <right>was calculated by dividing the number of observations of that fish in each habitat patch type by the total number of observations for that fish (n = 34 for all fish). selection ratios for each patch type were calculated by dividing the proportional patch use by the proportional patch availability for each fish. an average selection ratio for each habitat patch type was then calculated by averaging the values across all fish. confidence intervals for the selection ratios were calculated based on the bonferroni method whereby a = 0.05 was divided by n)1</right>
