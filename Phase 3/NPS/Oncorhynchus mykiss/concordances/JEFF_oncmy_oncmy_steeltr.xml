    <left>wider range of factors such as water temperature, flow and cover availability can trigger fish emigration (mcmahon &amp; hartman 1989; keeley 2001). under controlled condi- their tions mcmahon &amp; tash (1988) recorded increased emigration rates of the desert pupfish, cyprinodon macularius, in response to a doubling in densities and a consequent halving of available food and cover. keeley (2001) found both food and density, rather than either exclusively, to be important components of demo- graphic changes (emigration and mortality) in steelhead_trout ,</left>

    <right>. it is important to tease apart individual factors that influence fish migratory behaviour so that relative influence can be assessed. as a result of difficulties in isolating causal factors for emigration in the field, it has been suggested that only well-controlled laboratory studies can identify the true significant factors (mcmahon &amp; tash 1988; matter et al. 1989; mcmahon &amp; matter 2006). yet, these same experiments, on fish and non-fish taxa, have been mostly carried out on species which do not exhibit well-defined seasonal migration patterns (mcmahon &amp; tash</right>
