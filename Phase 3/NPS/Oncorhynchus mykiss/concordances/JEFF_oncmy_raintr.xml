    <right>, the extent of land cover influence on the diet composition of stream- residing juveniles is still an open but important question, particularly given their broad global distribution. our study evaluated the effect of land cover on diet composition and condition metrics of juvenile rainbow_trout in lake michigan tributaries. juveniles were collected in the fall of 2014 and 2015 from 18 sampling locations across the lake michigan basin and included a wide variety of land cover types. multivariate statistical procedures were used to quantitatively score sites along axes that maximized</right>

    <right>, the focal species of this study, are generalist feeders, with diet compositions reflective of the benthos (di prinzio, miserendino, &amp; casaux, 2013; godby, rutherford, &amp; mason, 2007). in michigan streams, the diets of juve- nile rainbow_trout largely consist of the most abundant taxa in the benthos (godby et al., 2007). similarly, fierro et al. (2016) noted that rainbow_trout predominantly preyed upon the dominant taxa in streams of southern chile, and their diet compositions were altered by riparian</right>
